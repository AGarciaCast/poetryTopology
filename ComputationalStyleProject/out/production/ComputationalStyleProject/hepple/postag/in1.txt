as I moved on by she asked what I was doing told her I was just running

after I was done I asked what she was doing told me she just played tennis

talked about our year another one in college told each other the same thing

talked about our lives and where they both were heading all told we knew just nothing

she told me her conclusion: that she was confused; that she needed to play more tennis

stood out in the sun our discourse lightly losing all sense of cold or proving

said she wanted some direction she could stand on avenue to go marching

all advice had laughed said she should like exploring they had never liked driving

amid all this confusion her eyes had shut down her conclusion was I just don't know

as I turned to go I asked why she was still there said she only ran alone

She IS -- my kind of rain ma'am

It was the best liveliest day I had seen , most happily .
