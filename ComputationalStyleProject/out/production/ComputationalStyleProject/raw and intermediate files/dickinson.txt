Emily Dickinson (1830-1886)
 
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the daughter
of a lawyer. She was educated at Amherst Academy (1834-47) and Mount
Holyoake (1847-8). In her early years she appears to have been a bright and
sociable young scholar, but in her twenties she began to withdraw from the
outside world. By her forties she had become a complete recluse, refusing to
leave her house and shunning all contact with strangers. A mystic by
inclination, she wrote much in secret, producing over two thousand poems,
only seven of which are known to have been published in her lifetime.
 
Her personal life remains something of a mystery although there is the
possibility that her seclusion might have been prompted by a failed love
affair. Her work certainly reflects a deep inner struggle spanning many years
and her verse is full of powerful allusions to storms, volcanic eruptions and
imprisonment.

"Arcturus" is his other name
 
70
 
"Arcturus" is his other name&mdash;
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
 
I slew a worm the other day&mdash;
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"&mdash;"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord&mdash;how frail are we"!
 
I pull a flower from the woods&mdash;
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath&mdash;
And has her in a "class"!
 
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat&mdash;
He sits erect in "Cabinets"&mdash;
The Clover bells forgot.
 
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now&mdash;
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
 
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"&mdash;
Whatever prank betides!
 
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed&mdash;
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come&mdash;
And laugh at me&mdash;and stare&mdash;
 
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl&mdash;
Old fashioned&mdash;naught&mdash;everything&mdash;
Over the stile of "Pearl."
 
Emily Dickinson

"Faith" is a fine invention

"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see&mdash;
But Microscopes are prudent

"Heaven" has different Signs&mdash;to me
 
575
 
"Heaven" has different Signs&mdash;to me&mdash;
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place&mdash;
And when again, at Dawn,
 
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills&mdash;
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals&mdash;
 
The Orchard, when the Sun is on&mdash;
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make&mdash;
Some Carnivals of Clouds&mdash;
 
The Rapture of a finished Day&mdash;
Returning to the West&mdash;
All these&mdash;remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"&mdash;
 
Itself be fairer&mdash;we suppose&mdash;
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace&mdash;
Not yet, our eyes can see&mdash;

"Heaven"&mdash;is what I cannot reach!
The Apple on the Tree&mdash;
Provided it do hopeless&mdash;hang&mdash;
That&mdash;"Heaven" is&mdash;to Me!
 
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud&mdash;
The interdicted Land&mdash;
Behind the Hill&mdash;the House behind&mdash;
There&mdash;Paradise&mdash;is found!
 
Her teasing Purples&mdash;Afternoons&mdash;
The credulous&mdash;decoy&mdash;
Enamored&mdash;of the Conjuror&mdash;
That spurned us&mdash;Yesterday!

"Hope" is the thing with feathers
 
254
 
"Hope" is the thing with feathers&mdash;
That perches in the soul&mdash;
And sings the tune without the words&mdash;
And never stops&mdash;at all&mdash;
 
And sweetest&mdash;in the Gale&mdash;is heard&mdash;
And sore must be the storm&mdash;
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm&mdash;
 
I've heard it in the chillest land&mdash;
And on the strangest Sea&mdash;
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb&mdash;of Me.

"Houses"&mdash;so the Wise Men tell me

"Houses"&mdash;so the Wise Men tell me&mdash;
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!
Mansions cannot let the tears in,
Mansions must exclude the storm!
 
"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"
I don't know him; snugly built!
Could the Children find the way there&mdash;
Some, would even trudge tonight!

"Why do I love" You, Sir?

The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer&mdash;Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.

Do not You&mdash;
And We know not&mdash;
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so&mdash;

Wherefore it shut&mdash;when He was by&mdash;

A Bird Came Down
 
A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.
 
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.
 
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad,--
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head
 
Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home
 
Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, splashless, as they swim.

A Book
 
There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul!

A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
Superior Glory be
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries
Are forever lost to me

Had I secured the Glow

With a glance and a Bow
Till I am firm in Heaven

Enlightening misery.

A drop fell on the apple tree
 
A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.
 
A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!
 
The dust replaced in hoisted roa
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.
 
The breezes brought dejected
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.

A fuzzy fellow, without feet,
Yet doth exceeding run!
Of velvet, is his Countenance,
And his Complexion, dun!
 
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!
Sometime, upon a bough,
From which he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passer-by!
 
All this in summer.
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence&mdash;
And struts in sewing silk!
 
Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!
A Feather on each shoulder!
You'd scarce recognize him!
 
By Men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly!

A light exists in spring
 
A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period.
When March is scarcely here
 
A color stands abroad
On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
But human naturefeels.
 
It waits upon the lawn;
It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
It almost speaks to me.
 
Then, as horizons step,
Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
It passes, and we stay:
 
A quality of loss
Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a sacrament.

A little bread—a crust—a crumb—
A little trust—a demijohn—
Can keep the soul alive—
Not portly, mind! but breathing—warm—
Conscious—as old Napoleon,
The night before the Crown!
 
A modest lot—A fame petite—
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore!
A Soldier's—balls! Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life!

A little East of Jordan

A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard&mdash;
 
Till morning touching mountain&mdash;
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast&mdash;to return&mdash;
 
Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except thou bless me"&mdash;Stranger!
The which acceded to&mdash;
 
Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God!

A loss of something ever felt I&mdash;
The first that I could recollect
Bereft I was&mdash;of what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect
 
A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dominion
Itself the only Prince cast out&mdash;
 
Elder, Today, a session wiser
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is&mdash;
I find myself still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces&mdash;

Touches my Forehead now and then

A narrow fellow in the grass
 
A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides;
You may have met him,--did you not,
His notice sudden is.
 
The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.
 
He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,
 
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun,--
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.
 
Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;
 
But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone.

For frigid hour of mind.

Scares muslin souls away;

A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.
 
A something in a summer's noon&mdash;
A depth&mdash;an Azure&mdash;a perfume&mdash;
Transcending ecstasy.
 
And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see&mdash;
 
Then veil my too inspecting face
Lets such a subtle&mdash;shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me&mdash;
 
The wizard fingers never rest&mdash;
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it narrow bed&mdash;
 
Still rears the East her amber Flag&mdash;
Guides still the sun along the Crag

So looking on&mdash;the night&mdash;the morn
Conclude the wonder gay&mdash;
And I meet, coming thro' the dews

A Thought went up my mind today&mdash;
That I have had before&mdash;
But did not finish&mdash;some way back&mdash;
I could not fix the Year&mdash;
 
Nor where it went&mdash;nor why it came
The second time to me&mdash;
Nor definitely, what it was&mdash;
Have I the Art to say&mdash;
 
But somewhere&mdash;in my Soul&mdash;I know&mdash;
I've met the Thing before&mdash;
It just reminded me&mdash;'twas all&mdash;
And came my way no more&mdash;

A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish,--some way back,
I could not fix the year,
 
Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.
 
But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me--'t was all--
And came my way no more.

To rejoin its own.

After a hundred years
 
After a hundred years
Nobody knows the place,--
Agony, that enacted there,
Motionless as peace.
 
Weeds triumphant ranged,
Strangers strolled and spelled
At the lone orthography
Of the elder dead.

Recollect the way,--
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory.

After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes
 
After great pain, a formal feeling comes--
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs--
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?
 
The Feet, mechanical, go round--
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought--
A Wooden way
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone--
 
This is the Hour of Lead--
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow--
First--Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--

Or played his chosen tune&mdash;
 
On Lute the least&mdash;the latest&mdash;
But just his Ear could know
That whatsoe'er delighted it,
I never would let go&mdash;
 
The foot to bear his errand&mdash;
A little Boot I know&mdash;
Would leap abroad like Antelope&mdash;
With just the grant to do&mdash;
 
His weariest Commandment&mdash;
A sweeter to obey,
Than "Hide and Seek"&mdash;
Or skip to Flutes&mdash;
Or all Day, chase the Bee&mdash;
 
Your Servant, Sir, will weary&mdash;
The Surgeon, will not come&mdash;
The World, will have its own&mdash;to do&mdash;
The Dust, will vex your Fame&mdash;
 
The Cold will force your tightest door
Some February Day,
But say my apron bring the sticks
To make your Cottage gay&mdash;
 
That I may take that promise
To Paradise, with me&mdash;
To teach the Angels, avarice,
You, Sir, taught first&mdash;to me.

Term of Light this Day begun!
Failless as the fair rotation
Of the Seasons and the Sun.

Yet upon His Purple Programme
Every Dawn, is first.

An altered look about the hills&mdash;
A Tyrian light the village fills&mdash;
A wider sunrise in the morn&mdash;
A deeper twilight on the lawn&mdash;
A print of a vermillion foot&mdash;
A purple finger on the slope&mdash;
A flippant fly upon the pane&mdash;
A spider at his trade again&mdash;
An added strut in Chanticleer&mdash;
A flower expected everywhere&mdash;

An English Breeze
 
UP with the sun, the breeze arose,
Across the talking corn she goes,
And smooth she rustles far and wide
Through all the voiceful countryside.
 
Through all the land her tale she tells;
She spins, she tosses, she compels
The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails
And all the trees in all the dales.
 
God calls us, and the day prepares
With nimble, gay and gracious airs:
And from Penzance to Maidenhead
The roads last night He watered.
 
God calls us from inglorious ease,
Forth and to travel with the breeze
While, swift and singing, smooth and strong
She gallops by the fields along.

Arcturus
 
"Arcturus" is his other name—
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
 
I slew a worm the other day—
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"—"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord—how frail are we"!
 
I pull a flower from the woods—
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath—
And has her in a "class"!
 
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat—
He sits erect in "Cabinets"—
The Clover bells forgot.
 
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now—
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
 
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"—
Whatever prank betides!
 
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed—
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come—
And laugh at me—and stare—
 
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl—
Old fashioned—naught—everything—
Over the stile of "Pearl."

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine
 
1
 
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!
 
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower&mdash;
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum&mdash;
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

Because I could not stop for Death
 
Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
 
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.
 
We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of grazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
 
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.
 
Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.

Because I could not stop for Death (712)
 
Because I could not stop for Death--
He kindly stopped for me--
The Carriage held but just Ourselves--
And Immortality.
 
We slowly drove--He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility--
 
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess--in the Ring--
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--
We passed the Setting Sun--
 
Or rather--He passed us--
The Dews drew quivering and chill--
For only Gossamer, my Gown--
My Tippet--only Tulle--
 
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground--
The Roof was scarcely visible--
The Cornice--in the Ground--
 
Since then--'tis Centuries--and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity--

Because the Bee may blameless hum
 
869
 
Because the Bee may blameless hum
For Thee a Bee do I become
List even unto Me.
 
Because the Flowers unafraid
May lift a look on thine, a Maid
Alway a Flower would be.
 
Nor Robins, Robins need not hide
When Thou upon their Crypts intrude
So Wings bestow on Me
Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz
That Bee to ride, or Flower of Furze
I that way worship Thee.

Beclouded
 
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.
 
A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.

Or any check at nightfall

Before you thought of spring,
 
Before you thought of spring,
Except as a surmise,
You see, God bless his suddenness,
A fellow in the skies
Of independent hues,
A little weather-worn,
Inspiriting habiliments
Of indigo and brown.
 
With specimens of song,
As if for you to choose,
Discretion in the interval,
With gay delays he goes
To some superior tree
Without a single leaf,
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic self!

Bird
 
A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.
 
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And the hopped sideways to the wall
To let a beetle pass.
 
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad, -
They looked like frightened beads, I thought
He stirred his velvet head.
 
Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rolled him softer home
 
Then oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, plashless, as they swim.

In the new Robin's ecstasy
Among astonished boughs&mdash;
How many trips the Tortoise makes&mdash;
How many cups the Bee partakes,
The Debauchee of Dews!
 
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
By withes of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite&mdash;
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due?
 
Who built this little Alban House
And shut the windows down so close
My spirit cannot see?
Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away,
Passing Pomposity?

By The Sea
 
I started early, took my dog,
And visited the sea;
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me.
 
And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands,
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground, upon the sands.
 
But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe,
And past my apron and my belt,
And past my bodice too,
 
And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelion's sleeve -
And then I started too.
 
And he - he followed close behind;
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle, - then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl.
 
Until we met the solid town,
No man he seemed to know;
And bowing with a mighty look
At me, the sea withdrew.

Cat
 
She sights a Bird - she chuckles -
She flattens - then she crawls -
She runs without the look of feet -
Her eyes increase to Balls -
 
Her Jaws stir - twitching - hungry -
Her Teeth can hardly stand -
She leaps, but Robin leaped the first -
Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,
 
The Hopes so juicy ripening -
You almost bathed your Tongue -

Chartless
 
I never saw a moor,
I never saw the sea;
Yet now I know how the heather looks,
And what a wave must be.
 
I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in Heaven;
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.

Cocoon above! Cocoon below!

Cocoon above! Cocoon below!
Stealthy Cocoon, why hide you so
What all the world suspect?
An hour, and gay on every tree
Your secret, perched in ecstasy
Defies imprisonment!
 
An hour in Chrysalis to pass,
Then gay above receding grass
A Butterfly to go!
A moment to interrogate,
Then wiser than a "Surrogate,"
The Universe to know!

Could I but ride indefinite
As doth the Meadow Bee
And visit only where I liked
And No one visit me
 
And flirt all Day with Buttercups
And marry whom I may
And dwell a little everywhere
Or better, run away
 
With no Police to follow
Or chase Him if He do
Till He should jump Peninsulas
To get away from me&mdash;

Upon a Raft of Air
And row in Nowhere all Day long
And anchor "off the Bar"
 
What Liberty! So Captives deem
Who tight in Dungeons are.

Toward which the forces creep
Past which forces retrograde
If it come in sleep
 
To suspend the Breath

Ignorant is it Life or Death

Or an Atom press
Or a Circle hesitate
In Circumference

Then crouch within the door&mdash;

But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flame's conditions,
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color, but the light
Of unanointed Blaze.
Least Village has its Blacksmith
Whose Anvil's even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugs&mdash;within&mdash;
Refining these impatient Ores
With Hammer, and with Blaze
Until the Designated Light

The eye had hurried by,
Except a perished creature
Entreat us tenderly
 
To ponder little workmanships
In crayon or in wool,
With 'This was last her fingers did,'
Industrious until
 
The thimble weighed too heavy,
The stitches stopped themselves,
And then 't was put among the dust
Upon the closet shelves.
 
A book I have, a friend gave,
Whose pencil, here and there,
Had notched the place that pleased him,--
At rest his fingers are.
 
Now, when I read, I read not,
For interrupting tears
Obliterate the etchings
Too costly for repairs.

With last Delight I own!
 
It cannot be my Spirit&mdash;
For that was thine, before&mdash;
I ceded all of Dust I knew&mdash;
What Opulence the more
Had I&mdash;a freckled Maiden,
Whose farthest of Degree,
Was&mdash;that she might&mdash;
Some distant Heaven,
Dwell timidly, with thee!
 
Sift her, from Brow to Barefoot!
Strain till your last Surmise&mdash;
Drop, like a Tapestry, away,
Before the Fire's Eyes&mdash;
Winnow her finest fondness&mdash;
But hallow just the snow
Intact, in Everlasting flake&mdash;
Oh, Caviler, for you!

Dying (I heard a fly buzz when I died)
 
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
Between the heaves of storm.
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
Be witnessed in his power.
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
What portion of me I
Could make assignable, -- and then
There interposed a fly,
 
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
I could not see to see.

Perhaps he doesn't know the House&mdash;
This way, Jesus, Let him pass!
 
Somebody run to the great gate
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait!

And Love and the Reverse.

Each life converges to some centre
 
Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still;
Exists in every human nature
A goal,
 
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
Too fair
For credibility's temerity
To dare.
 
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
To touch,
 
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
How high
Unto the saints' slow diligence
The sky!
 
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
But then,
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again.

Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.
Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
At her low gate;

Choose one
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.

First Robin
 
I dreaded that first robin so,
But he is mastered now,
And I'm accustomed to him grown,--
He hurts a little, though.
 
I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by,
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me.
 
I dared not meet the daffodils,
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own.
 
I wished the grass would hurry,
So when 't was time to see,
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me.
 
I could not bear the bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go:
What word had they for me?
 
They're here, though; not a creature failed,
No blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me,
The Queen of Calvary.
 
Each one salutes me as he goes,
And I my childish plumes
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums.

For every Bird a Nest
 
143
 
For every Bird a Nest&mdash;
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round&mdash;
 
Wherefore when boughs are free&mdash;
Households in every tree&mdash;
Pilgrim be found?
 
Perhaps a home too high&mdash;
Ah Aristocracy!
The little Wren desires&mdash;
 
Perhaps of twig so fine&mdash;
Of twine e'en superfine,
Her pride aspires&mdash;
 
The Lark is not ashamed
To build upon the ground
Her modest house&mdash;
 
Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice?

And so, instructed by my own,

From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
As Lady from her Door
Emerged&mdash;a Summer Afternoon&mdash;
Repairing Everywhere&mdash;
 
Without Design&mdash;that I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On Miscellaneous Enterprise
The Clovers&mdash;understood&mdash;

Contracting in a Field
Where Men made Hay&mdash;
Then struggling hard
With an opposing Cloud&mdash;
 
Where Parties&mdash;Phantom as Herself&mdash;
To Nowhere&mdash;seemed to go
In purposeless Circumference&mdash;
As 'twere a Tropic Show&mdash;
 
And notwithstanding Bee&mdash;that worked&mdash;

Disdained them, from the Sky&mdash;

Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive Mass.
 
No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness.
 
Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify
 
Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now

Save by loving sunrise
Looking for her face.
Save by feet unnumbered
Pausing at the place.

God gave a loaf to every bird
 
God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve,--
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine,--
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.
 
It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel,--
An Indiaman--an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.

Pray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!
 
Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost&mdash;
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown"&mdash;
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home&mdash;
 
I'm glad I don't believe it
For it would stop my breath&mdash;
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth!
I'm glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the might Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.

Good night! which put the candle out?
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
Extinguished, now, for you!

Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
To purer reveille!

Out of Plumb of Speech.
 
When the Sea return no Answer
By the Line and Lead
Proves it there's no Sea, or rather
A remoter Bed?

Have you got a Brook in your little heart
 
136
 
Have you got a Brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so&mdash;
 
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there,
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there&mdash;
 
Why, look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the fills,
And the bridges often go&mdash;
 
And later, in August it may be&mdash;
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life,
Some burning noon go dry!

Whistled itself a tune&mdash;

An Anodyne so sweet&mdash;
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled&mdash;
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way&mdash;

Heaven

"Heaven" has different Signs—to me—
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place—
And when again, at Dawn,
 
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills—
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals—
 
The Orchard, when the Sun is on—
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make—
Some Carnivals of Clouds—
 
The Rapture of a finished Day—
Returning to the West—
All these—remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"—
 
Itself be fairer—we suppose—
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace—
Not yet, our eyes can see—

Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
 
649
 
Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Came the Darker Way&mdash;
Carriages&mdash;Be Sure&mdash;and Guests&mdash;too&mdash;
But for Holiday
 
'Tis more pitiful Endeavor
Than did Loaded Sea
O'er the Curls attempt to caper
It had cast away&mdash;
 
Never Bride had such Assembling&mdash;
Never kinsmen kneeled
To salute so fair a Forehead&mdash;
Garland be indeed&mdash;
 
Fitter Feet&mdash;of Her before us&mdash;
Than whatever Brow
Art of Snow&mdash;or Trick of Lily
Possibly bestow
 
Of Her Father&mdash;Whoso ask Her&mdash;
He shall seek as high
As the Palm&mdash;that serve the Desert&mdash;
To obtain the Sky&mdash;
 
Distance&mdash;be Her only Motion&mdash;
If 'tis Nay&mdash;or Yes&mdash;
Acquiescence&mdash;or Demurral&mdash;
Whosoever guess&mdash;
 
He&mdash;must pass the Crystal Angle
That obscure Her face&mdash;
He&mdash;must have achieved in person
Equal Paradise&mdash;

Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night

Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night
Had scarcely deigned to lie&mdash;
When, stirring, for Belief's delight,
My Bride had slipped away&mdash;
 
If 'twas a Dream&mdash;made solid&mdash;just
The Heaven to confirm&mdash;
Or if Myself were dreamed of Her&mdash;
The power to presume&mdash;
 
With Him remain&mdash;who unto Me&mdash;
Gave&mdash;even as to All&mdash;
A Fiction superseding Faith&mdash;
By so much&mdash;as 'twas real&mdash;

Home
 
Years I had been from home,
And now, before the door
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before
 
Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, - just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?
 
I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.
 
I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.
 
I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there.
 
I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house.

Hope is the thing with feathers
 
Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,
 
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
 
I've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.

I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching
Next to mine,
And summon them to drink;
 
Crackling with fever, they Essay,
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.
 
The hands still hug the tardy glass&mdash;
The lips I would have cooled, alas&mdash;
Are so superfluous Cold&mdash;
 
I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould&mdash;
 
Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak&mdash;
 
And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake&mdash;
 
If, haply, any say to me
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.

Where You were not --
That self -- were Hell to Me --
 
So We must meet apart --
You there -- I -- here --
With just the Door ajar
That Oceans are -- and Prayer --
And that White Sustenance --
Despair --

I cannot live with You (No. 640)
 
I cannot live with You--
It would be Life--
And Life is over there--
Behind the Shelf
 
The Sexton keeps the Key to--
Putting up
Our Life--His Porcelain--
Like a Cup--
 
Discarded of the Housewife--
Quaint--or Broke--
A newer Sevres pleases--
Old Ones crack--
 
I could not die--with You--
For One must wait
To shut the Other's Gaze down--
You--could not--
 
And I--could I stand by
And see You--freeze--
Without my Right of Frost--
Death's privilege?
 
Nor could I rise--with You--
Because Your Face
Would put out Jesus'--
That New Grace
 
Glow plain--and foreign
On my homesick Eye--
Except that You than He
Shone closer by--
 
They'd judge Us--How--
For You--served Heaven--You know,
Or sought to--
I could not--
 
Because You saturated Sight--
And I had no more Eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise
 
And were You lost, I would be--
Though My Name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fame--
 
And were You--saved--
And I--condemned to be

I cannot live with you,

It would be life,
And life is over there
Behind the shelf
 
The sexton keeps the key to,
Putting up
Our life, his porcelain,
Like a cup
 
Discarded of the housewife,
Quaint or broken;
A newer Sevres pleases,
Old ones crack.
 
I could not die with you,
For one must wait
To shut the other's gaze down,--
You could not.
 
And I, could I stand by
And see you freeze,
Without my right of frost,
Death's privilege?
 
Nor could I rise with you,
Because your face
Would put out Jesus'.
That new grace
 
Glow plain and foreign
On my homesick eye,
Except that you, than he
Shone closer by.
 
They'd judge us--how?
For you served Heaven, you know
Or sought to;
I could not,
 
Because you saturated sight,
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise.
 
And were you lost, I would be,
Though my name
Rang loudest
On the heavenly fame.
 
And were you saved,
And I condemned to be

Where you were not,
That self were hell to me.
 
So we must keep apart,
You there, I here,
With just the door ajar
That oceans are,
And prayer,
And that pale svustenance,
Despair!

I can't tell you&mdash;but you feel it&mdash;
Nor can you tell me&mdash;
Saints, with ravished slate and pencil
Solve our April Day!
 
Sweeter than a vanished frolic
From a vanished green!
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen
Round a Ledge of dream!
 
Modest, let us walk among it
With our faces veiled&mdash;
As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God!
 
Not for me&mdash;to prate about it!
Not for you&mdash;to say
To some fashionable Lady
"Charming April Day"!
 
Rather&mdash;Heaven's "Peter Parley"!
By which Children slow
To sublimer Recitation
Are prepared to go!

I cautious, scanned my little life
 
178
 
I cautious, scanned my little life&mdash;
I winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be a-dreaming laid.
 
I put the latter in a Barn&mdash;
The former, blew away.
I went one winter morning
And lo - my priceless Hay
 
Was not upon the "Scaffold"&mdash;
Was not upon the "Beam"&mdash;
And from a thriving Farmer&mdash;
A Cynic, I became.
 
Whether a Thief did it&mdash;
Whether it was the wind&mdash;
Whether Deity's guiltless&mdash;
My business is, to find!
 
So I begin to ransack!
How is it Hearts, with Thee?
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee?

I could not prove the Years had feet&mdash;
Yet confident they run
Am I, from symptoms that are past
And Series that are done&mdash;
 
I find my feet have further Goals&mdash;

That felt so ample&mdash;Yesterday&mdash;
Today's&mdash;have vaster claims&mdash;

Was competent to me&mdash;
But something awkward in the fit&mdash;

I cried at Pity&mdash;not at Pain&mdash;
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child"&mdash;and something in her voice
Convicted me&mdash;of me&mdash;
 
So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things&mdash;
To look at, like a Toy&mdash;
 
To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled&mdash;
And carried, I supposed&mdash;to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold&mdash;
 
But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh&mdash;
And so and so&mdash;had been to me,
Had God willed differently.
 
I wish I knew that Woman's name&mdash;
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say
 
She's "sorry I am dead"&mdash;again&mdash;
Just when the Grave and I&mdash;
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby&mdash;

I cross till I am weary
A Mountain&mdash;in my mind&mdash;
More Mountains&mdash;then a Sea&mdash;
More Seas&mdash;And then
A Desert&mdash;find&mdash;
 
And My Horizon blocks
With steady&mdash;drifting&mdash;Grains
Of unconjectured quantity&mdash;
As Asiatic Rains&mdash;
 
Nor this&mdash;defeat my Pace&mdash;
It hinder from the West
But as an Enemy's Salute
One hurrying to Rest&mdash;
 
What merit had the Goal&mdash;
Except there intervene
Faint Doubt&mdash;and far Competitor&mdash;
To jeopardize the Gain?
 
At last&mdash;the Grace in sight&mdash;
I shout unto my feet&mdash;
I offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meet&mdash;
 
They strive&mdash;and yet delay&mdash;
They perish&mdash;Do we die&mdash;
Or is this Death's Experiment&mdash;
Reversed&mdash;in Victory?

I Died For Beauty
 
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
 
He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.
 
And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He is mastered, now,
I'm accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though&mdash;
 
I thought If I could only live
Till that first Shout got by&mdash;
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me&mdash;
 
I dared not meet the Daffodils&mdash;
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own&mdash;
 
I wished the Grass would hurry&mdash;
So&mdash;when 'twas time to see&mdash;
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch&mdash;to look at me&mdash;
 
I could not bear the Bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go,
What word had they, for me?
 
They're here, though; not a creature failed&mdash;
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me&mdash;
The Queen of Calvary&mdash;
 
Each one salutes me, as he goes,
And I, my childish Plumes,
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking Drums&mdash;
