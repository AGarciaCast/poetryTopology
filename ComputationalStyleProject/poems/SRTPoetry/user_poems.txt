The sparkling broken glass
Rests on the ground.
The glass was broken by my foot.
I will help. He can help. She may skip.
A semi-rhyme will bend
a line's ending.
This poem shouldn't be
considered anything.
It should be happier,
sadder, happilier, or is it more happily,
(HAPPIEST!)
Professing the Kaplan Method of Something.
(Can it tell if Method starts a sentence or is NNP?)
What about
Robots, Mr. Chau's Chinese Fast Food,
C'est pas--
c'est moi--
it is all--of--us.

Mangoes
Tracy K Smith
The woman in a blouse
The color of daylight
Motions to her daughter not to slouch.
They wait without luggage.
They have been waiting
Since before the station smelled
Of cigarettes. Shadows
Fill the doorway and fade
One by one
Into bloated faces.
She'd like to swat at them
Like the lazy flies
That swarm her kitchen.

She considers her hands, at rest
Like pale fruits in her lap. Should she
Gather them in her skirt and hurry
Down the tree in reverse, greedy
For a vivid mouthful of something
Sweet? The sun gets brighter
As it drops low. Soon the room
Will glow gold with late afternoon.
Still no husband, face creased from sleep,
His one bag across his chest. Soon
The windows will grow black. Still
No one with his hand always returning
To the hollow below her back.

Desire is a city of yellow houses
As it surrenders its drunks to the night.
It is the drunks on ancient bicycles
Warbling into motionless air,
And the pigeons, asleep in branches,
That will repeat the same songs tomorrow
Believing them new. Desire is the woman
Awake now over a bowl of ashes
That flutter and drop like abandoned feathers.
It's the word widow spelled slowly in air
With a cigarette that burns
On its own going.

North Carolina Junction
David M Kaplan
as i moved on by
she asked what i was doing
told her i was
just running

after i was done
i asked what she was doing
told me she just
played tennis

talked about our year
another one in college
told each other
the same thing

talked about our lives
and where they both were heading
all told we knew
just nothing

she told me her conclusion:
that she was confused
that she needed to
play more tennis

stood out in the sun
our discourse lightly losing
all sense of cold
or proving

said she wanted some
direction she could stand on
avenue to
go marching

all advice had laughed
said she should like exploring
they had never
liked driving

amid all this confusion
her eyes had shut down
her conclusion was
i just don't know

as i turned to go
i asked why she was still there
said she only
ran alone

Collide
Howie Day
The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide

You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide

Ever The Same
Rob Thomas
We were drawn from the weeds
We were brave like soldiers
Falling down under the pale moonlight
You were holding to me
Like a someone broken
And I couldn't tell you but I'm telling you now

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Fall on me
Tell me everything you want me to be
Forever with you forever in me
Ever the same

We would stand in the wind
We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold and we're scared
And we've both been shaken
Look at us
Man, this doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Fall on me tell me everything you want me to be
Forever with you
Forever in me
Ever the same

Call on me
I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me
Forever it's you
Forever in me
Ever the same

You may need me there
To carry all your weight
But you're no burden I assure
You tide me over
With a warmth I'll not forget
But I can only give you love
