Ants Marching
Dave Matthews
He wakes up in the morning
Does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling
Never changes a thing
The week ends the week begins
She thinks, we look at each other
Wondering what the other is thinking
But we never say a thing
These crimes between us grow deeper 
Goes to visit his mommy
She feeds him well his concerns
He forgets them
And remembers being small
Playing under the table and dreaming 

Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
Lights down, you up and die 
Driving in on this highway
All these cars and upon the sidewalk
People in every direction
No words exchanged
No time to exchange 

And all the little ants are marching
Red and black antennas waving
They all do it the same
They all do it the same way

Candyman teasing the thoughts of a
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss
Programs cutting the corners
Loose end, loose end, cut, cut
On the fence, could not to offend
Cut, cut, cut, cut 

Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
Lights down, you up and die

Tripping Billies
Dave Matthews
We were above
You standing underneath us
We were not yet lovers
Dragons were smoked
Bumblebees were stinging us
I was soon to be crazy
Eat, drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die
'Cause we're tripping billies 

We're wearing nothing
Nothing but out shadows
Shadows falling down on the beach sand
Remembering once,
Out on the beaches we wore
Pineapple grass bracelets 

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race
'Cause we're tripping billies 

We are all sitting
Legs crossed round a fire
My yellow flame she dances
Tequila drinking oh our
Minds will wonder
To wonderous places 

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race 

Eat, drink and be merry
For tomorrow we die

Recently
Dave Matthews
Recently I've been
All of content and dreaming I have been
'Cause I been lately seeing
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street
People stare and we just ignore everything
People stare and we just ignore them
And they go away, go away

She comes to me
I watch her drink
I watch her comb her hair
Both say that we never before have
Felt as recently 

People stare and we just ignore
What's the use in hiding out
She says all the time
Let their eyes do the worrying about

She and me go to places quiet
Where we are quite alone
Kiss and we hold together
We will be until we done 

People stare and we just ignore
What's the use in hiding out
She says all the time
Let their eyes do the worring about 

Both say the we never before
Never before have felt as recently
People stare and we just ignore everything
People stare and we just ignore them
And they go away, go away

Satellite
Dave Matthews
Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station
Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

Satellite, headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle? 

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Rest high above the clouds no resrictions
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes. 

Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How i wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station 

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Rest high above the clouds no restrictions
Television you bounce from the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling
I laugh about this world in my satellite eyes.

One Sweet World
Dave Matthews
Nine planets round the sun
Only one does the sun embrace
Upon this watered one
So much we take for granted 
So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our mother's arms
For here we can rest safely 

If green should slip to grey
But our hearts still bloody be
And if mountains crumble away
And the river dry Would it stop the stepping feet

Take all that we can get
When it's done
Nobody left to bury here
Nobody left to dig the holes
And here we can rest safely 

One sweet world
Around a star is spinning
One sweet world
And in her breath I'm swimming
And here we will rest in peace

Song That Jane Likes
Dave Matthews
And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again
Would you like to play
With the thought of a friend
In a distant passing stage
While you lie around
With hands up and down
So resigned you will fall down

While you around here play
Wild on the warm and far away
While you around here play
The days keep scrbbling themselves
In tidy lines

Would like to play
With a fool holding hands
With a one-eyed jack of spades
While on the deck they sing
All of the captain's cards are kings
Still he and the queen are lost at sea
I hope it isn't you and me

And I'll be back 'round again
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend
And we'll find that place
That we had danced so long ago

And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again
With this resigned
The letter I sign

******
Minarets
Dave Matthews
Santa Maria choose your children
Santa Maria virgin child
all our wars over you we are fighting
and all our time faith justifying
Brother caged Babylon will fall
Sister chained and bound, beaten and bleeding
The tv's on, to me this explains it
Wearing a tie like daddy speaks it
Screaming from the minarets
Later on we'll all be dancing
Screaming from the minarets
Yes indeed i'm making faces
Rain on the ground in a space
God has grown
Alone till a man looking glass in his hand
He is holding up to you
What you see
What you see
What you see
What you see is human
Screaming from the minarets

Seek Up
Dave Matthews
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling
Fall back again, fall back again,
Fall back again, fall back again 
Oh, life it seems a struggle between
What we think what we see
I'm not going to change my ways
Just to please you or appease you
Inside a crowd, five billion proud
Willing to punch it out
Right, wrong, weak, strong
Ashes to ashes all fall down
Look around about this round
About this merry-go-round around
If at all God's gaze upon us fall
His mischievous grin, look at him 

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that
Our emotions can be swept away
Forget about being guilty,
We are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

Sit awhile with TV's hungry child
Big belly swelled
Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke
Keep alive those hungy eyes
Take a look at me, what you see in me,
Mirror look at me
Face it all, face it all again

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that your emotions can be
Wept away, kept at bay
Forget about being guilty, i am innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion
And our cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion,
Sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster
For him to fight your wars for you
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not
Going--ha, ha 

Say, say 

Look at me in my fancy car
And my bank account
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down
Into my grave, I'd save
Take a look again, take a look again,
Take a look again
Everyday things change,...stay the same 

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that
Your emotions can be swept away
Intentions are not wicked,
Don't be tricked into thinking so
Soon we will all find our lives swept away 

You seek up an emotion
And our cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion,
Sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster
For him to fight your wars for you
But when he finds his way to you,
The devil's not going--ha, ha
Fall back again, fall back again, fall back again...

I'll Back You Up
Dave Matthews
I remember thinking
I'll go on forever only knowing
I'll see you again
But I know
The touch of you is so hard to remember
But like that touch I know no other 
And for sure we have danced
In the risk of each other
Would like to dance
Around the world with me 

I'll be falling all about my own thing
And I know your the heaviest weight
When your not here that's hung
Around my head 

And your lips burn wild
Thrown from the face of a child
And in your eyes
The seeing of the greatest few
Do what you will, always
Walk where you like, your steps
Do as you please, I'll back you up 

I remember thinking
Sometimes we walk
Sometimes we run away
But I know
No matter how fast we are running
Somehow we keep
Somehow we keep up with each other

I'll be falling all about my own thing
And i know your the heaviest weight
When your not here that's hung
Around my head 

And your lips burn wild
Thrown from the face of a child
And in your eyes
The seeing of the greatest few
Do what you will, always
Walk where you like, your steps
Do as you please, I'll back you up

Christmas Song
Dave Matthews
She was his girl; he was her boyfriend
She be his wife; take him as her husband
A surprise on the way, any day, any day
One healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy
The wise men came three made their way
To shower him with love
While he lay in the hay
Shower him with love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
Not very much of his childhood was known
Kept his mother Mary worried
Always out on his own
He met another Mary for a reasonable fee, less than
Reputable as known to be 

His heart was full of love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around
When Jesus Christ was nailed to the his tree
Said "oh, Daddy-o I can see how it all soon will be
I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene
Instead I fear I spill the blood of my children all around"

The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around
So the story goes, so I'm told
The people he knew were
Less than golden hearted
Gamblers and robbers
Drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers
Like you and me 

Rumors insisited he soon would be
For his deviations
Taken into custody by the authorities
Less informed than he.
Drinkers and jokers. all soul searchers
Searching for love love love
Love love love
Love love is all around

Preparations were made
For his celebration day
He said "eat this bread and think of it as me
Drink this wine and dream it will be
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children all around"
The blood of our children all around

Father up above, why in all this anger have you fill
Me up with love
Fill me love love love
Love love love
Love love
And the blood of our children all around

Dancing Nancies
Dave Matthews
Could I have been
A parking lot attendant
Could I have been
A millionaire in Bel Air
Could I have been Lost somewhere in Paris
Could I have been
Your little brother
Could I have been
Anyone other than me
Could I have been
Anyone other than me
Could I have been
Anyone other than me
Could I have been 
Anyone

He stands touch his hair his shoes untied
Tongue gaping stare
Could I have been a magnet for money?
Could I have been anyone other than me?

Twenty three and so tired of life
Such a shame to throw it all away
The images grow darker still
Could I have been anyone other than me? Then I

Look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy

Iam who I am who I am who am I
Requesting some enlightenment
Could I have been anyone other than me?

Sing and dance I'll play for you tonight
And thrill at it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I'll work it out then I

Look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy

Falling out of a world of lies
Could I have been dancing nancy
Could I have been anyone other than me?

Warehouse
Dave Matthews
Hey reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginning
You and I let us fumble around in the touches
And be sure to

Leave all the lights on
So I can see the black cat changing colors
And walk under ladders
And travel my eyes over you
Hey we have found
Becoming one in a million Slip into the crowd
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk

Keep all your sights on
The black cat changing colors
I can walk under ladders
And swim as the tides choose to turn me

And here I sit
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistic bit
And soon I fade away, fade away

This I admit
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it
Smell touch feel
How could this rhythm ever quit
Bags packed on a plane
Hopefully to heaven

Shut up I'm thinking
I had a clue now it's gone forever
Sitting over these bones
You can read in whatever you're needing to

Keep all your sights on
The big bad black cat that's
Changing colors

It's not the colors that matter
But that they'll all fade away

This I admit
Seems so full
Hard to believe an end to it
Warehouse is bare
Nothing at all inside of it
Walls and halls have disappeared

My love I love to stay here
In the warehouse

The Best Of What's Around
Dave Matthews
Hey my friend
It seems your eyes are troubled
Care to share your times with me
Would you say you're feeling low and so
A good idea would be to get it off your mind

See, you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
And so can pull on through
Whatever tears at us
Whatever holds us down
And if nothing can be done
We'll make the best of what's around

Turns out not where but who you're with
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around

If you hold on tight
To what you think is your thing
You may find you're missing all the rest
She run up into the light surprised
Her arms are open
Her mind's eye is

Seeing things from a
Clearer side than most can dream
On a better road I feel
So you could say she's safe
Whatever tears at her
Whatever holds her down
And if nothing can be done
She'll make the best of what's around

Turns out not where but what you think
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around

Lover Lay Down
Dave Matthews
Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head
Slip into my lover's hands
Kiss me oh won't you kiss me now
And sleep I would inside your mouth

Don't be us too shy
Knowing it's no big surprise
That I will wait for you
I will wait for no one but you

Look please lover lay down
Spend this time with me
Together share this smile
Lover lay down

Walk with me, walk with you
Hold my hand your hands
So much we have dreamed
And you were so much younger
Hard to explain that we are stronger

A million reasons life to deny
Let's toss them away
See you and me we
Lay down look see
She and he
By my lover's side
Together share this smile
Each other's tears to cry
Together share this smile
Lover lay down

Oh please
Look please lover lay down
Oh please lover lay down
And you weep
Lover lay down
Cause it's over
Lover lay down
Say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover
Could I love you
Could you love me
Could I love you
Could you love me
Could I love you
Could you love me
Could I love you
Could you love me

'Til we dance away
'Til we dance away
Chasing me all around
Leading me all around
Leading me all around in circles
Leading me all around
Leading me all around in circles

Typical Situation
Dave Matthews
Ten fingers we have each
Nine planets around the sun repeat
Eight ball is the last if you triumphant be
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea

It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices

Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different 
Why are you that way
If you don't step in line
We'll lock you away

Six senses keeping
Five around a sense of self
Four seasons turn on and turn off
I can see three corners from this corner
Two is a perfect number
But one

Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different
Why are you that way
If you don't step in line
We'll lock you away

It's a typical situation
In these typical times
We can't do a thing about it

Crash Into Me
Dave Matthews
You've got your ball
you've got your chain
Tied to me tight tie me up again
Who's got their claws
in you my friend
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock
and sweet you roll
Lost for you I'm so lost for you 
You come crash into me
And I come into you,
I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream 

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare-boned and crazy for you
When you come crash
into me, baby
And I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream
If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
to forgive me
In my haste
When I'm holding you so girl...
close to me 

Oh and you come crash
into me, baby
And I come into you
Hike up your skirt a little more
and show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
and show your world to me
In a boys dream... In a boys dream 

Oh I watch you there
through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
wear it so well
Tied up and twisted,
the way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash
into me

Lie In Our Graves
Dave Matthews
When I step into the light
My arms are open wide
When I step into the light
My eyes searching wildly
Would you not like to be
Sitting on top of the world with
your legs hanging free
Would you not like to be ok, ok, ok?

When I'm walking by the water
Splish splash me and you takin a bath
When I'm walking by the water
Come up through my toes
To my ankles
To my head
To my soul
And I'm blown away 

When I'm walking by the water
Splish splash me and you takin a bath
When I'm walking by the water
Come up through my toes
To my ankles
To my head
To my soul
And I'm blown away
I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Wondering if we had
spent our living days well
I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Dreaming of things that we
might have been 

I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Wondering if we had
spent our living days well
I can't believe that we would
lie in our graves
Dreaming of things that we
might have been

Would you not like to be
I can't believe that you
would not like to be
Would you not like to be
ok, ok, ok

#41
Dave Matthews
Come and see
I swear by now I'm playing time against my troubles
I'm coming slow but speeding
Do you wish a dance and while
I'm in the front
The play on time is won
But the difficulty is coming here 
I will go in this way
And find my own way out
I won't tell you to stay
But I'm coming to much more
Me
All at once the ghosts come back
Reeling in you now
What if they came down crushing
Remember when I used to play for
all of the loneliness that nobody
notices now
I'm begging slow I'm coming here
Only waiting I wanted to stay
I wanted to play,
I wanted to love you 
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads my way 
I'm coming waltzing back and
moving into your head
Please, I wouldn't pass this by
I wouldn't take any more than
What sort of man goes by
I will bring water
Why won't you ever be glad
It melts into wonder
I came in praying for you
Why won't you run
in the rain and play
Let the tears splash all over you

Rapunzel
Dave Matthews
Open wide Oh so good I'll eat you
Take me for a ride
In your sweet delicious
Perfect little mouth
Thereupon I linger
You will have no doubt
I'll do my best for you, I do
Love
Let's stop to get it going
Lost myself just thinking
About the two of us
From each other drinking
Begin with the lips
Fingertips and kissing
Turn me inside out
I do my best for you
Up and down we go
From the top you push me
This is such a thrill
Lost in love and dancing
Shake your tambourine
You blow my head open
Of this there's no doubt
I do my best for you I do
For you I would crawl
Through the darkest dungeon
Climb the castle wall
If you are my Rapunzel
You let your hair down
Right in through your window
Good they locked the door
I do my best for you
I think the world of you
All of my heart I do
Blood through my veins for you
You alone have all of me
I give my world to you
To you I will be true
Too good to be real
Smell of something cooking
My soul you're to steal
Food of love we're filling
What you've given me
For it there is no measure
Of one thing I am sure
I'll give my best for you
I think the world of you
All of my heart I do
Blood through my veins for you
You alone have all of me
From you my strength is full
To carry your burdens too
I give my world to you
Hip lock up so tight
You drive me crazy
Crazy is all right
With you looking at me
You make me feel high
Every single thing you do to me
is like I'm drunk
I do my best for you, I do

The Last Stop
Dave Matthews
Fire The sun is well asleep
Moon is high above
Fire grows from the east
How is this
Hate so deep
Lead us all so blindly killing killing
Fools we are
If hate's the gate to peace
This is the last stop
For raining tears
War
The only way to Peace
I don't fall for that
Raining tears
You're righteous, so righteous
You're always so right
Go ahead and dream
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one
Raining tears
Oh no
Gracious even God
Bloodied the cross
Your sins are washed enough
Mother's cry
"Is hate so deep
Must a baby's bones
This hungry fire feed?"
As smoke clouds roll in 
The symphony of death
This is the last stop
Scream
Right is wrong now
Shut up you big lie
This black and white lie
You comb your hair to hide
Your lying eyes
You're righteous, so righteous
You're always so right
But why your lie
Go ahead and dream
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one
This is the last stop
Here there's more than is showing up
Hope that we can break it down
It's not so black and white
You're righteous
You're righteous
You're righteous
You're always so right
There you are nailing a good tree
Then say forgive me, forgive me
Why
Raining tears
This is the last stop
Here there is more than is showing up
Hope that we can break it down
It's not so black and white

Don't Drink The Water
Dave Matthews
Come out come out
No use in hiding
Come now come now
Can you not see? 
There's no place here
What were you expecting
Not room for both
Just room for me
So you will lay your arms down
Yes I will call this home

Away away
You have been banished
Your land is gone
And given me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home
What's this you say
You feel a right to remain
Then stay and I will bury you
What's that you say
Your father's spirit still lives in this place
I will silence you

Here's the hitch
Your horse is leaving
Don't miss your boat
It's leaving now
And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home
I have no time to justify to you
Fool you're blind, move aside for me
All I can say to you my new neighbor
Is you must move on or I will bury you

Now as I rest my feet by this fire
Those hands once warmed here
I have retired them
I can breathe my own air 
I can sleep more soundly
Upon these poor souls 
I'll build heaven and call it home
'Cause you're all dead now
I live with my justice
I live with my greedy need
I live with no mercy
I live with my frenzied feeding
I live with my hatred
I live with my jealousy
I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water

Crush
Dave Matthews
Crazy how it feels tonight
Crazy how you make it all alright love
You crush me with the things you do
I do for you anything too
Sitting, smoking, feeling high
In this moment it feels so right
Lovely lady
I am at your feet
God I want you so badly
I wonder this
Could tomorrow be
So wondrous as you there sleeping
Let's go drive 'til morning comes
Watch the sunrise
To fill our souls up
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round
Here I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
Is this real or am I dreaming
Lovely lady
Let me drink you please
I won't spill a drop, I promise you
Lying under this spell you cast on me
Each moment
The more I love you
Crush me
Come on
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just knowing that the world is round
Here I'm dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
Is it real or am I dreaming
Lovely lady I will treat you sweetly
Adore you
I mean
You crush me
It's times like these
When my faith I feel
And I know
How I love you
Come on
Lady
It's crazy I'm thinking
Just as long as you're around
And here I'll be dancing on the ground
Am I right side up or upside down
To each other we'll be facing
By love we'll beat back the pain
we've found
You know
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside
My friend
With each moment the more I love you
Crush me
Come on
Lady
So much you have given love
That I would give you back
Again and again
Meaning I'll hold you
And please
Let me always

Pig
Dave Matthews
Isn't it strange
How we move our lives for another day
Like skipping a beat
What if a great wave should
wash us all away
Just thinking out loud
Don't mean to dwell on this dying thing 
But looking at blood
It's alive right now
Deep and sweet within
Pouring through our veins
Intoxicate moving wine to tears
Drinking it deep
Then an evening spent dancing
It's you and me
This love will open our world
From the dark side we can see a glow of something bright 
There's much more than we see here
Don't burn the day away

Is this not enough
This blessed sip of life
Is it not enough
Staring down at the ground
Oh then complain and pray
more from above
Greedy little pig
Stop just watch your world trickle away
Oh it's your problem now
It'll all be dead and gone in
a few short years
Just love will open our eyes
Just love will put the hope in our minds
Much more than we could ever know
Don't burn the day away

Come sister
my brother
Shake up your bones shake up your feet
I'm saying open up
And let the rain come pouring in
Wash out this tired notion
That the best is yet to come
But while you're dancing on the ground
Don't think of when you're gone
Love! love!? what more is there?
We need the light of love in here
Don't beat your head
Dry your eyes
Let the love in there
There are bad times
But that's ok
Just look for love in it
Don't burn the day away

Look
Here are we
On this starry night staring into space
And I must say
I feel as small as dust
Lying down here
What point could there be troubling
Head down wondering what will
become of me
Why concern we cannot see
But no reason to abandon it
Time is short but that's all right
Maybe I'll go in the middle of the night
Take your hands from your eyes, my love
Everything must end some time
Don't burn the day away

Come sister
My brother
Shake up your bones shake up your feet
I'm saying open up
And let the rain come flooding in
Wash out this tired notion
That the best is yet to come
But while you're dancing on the ground
Don't think of when you're gone
Love! love!? what more is there?
We need the light of love in here
Don't beat your head
Dry your eyes
Let the love in there
There are bad times
But that's ok
Just look for love in it

When The World Ends
Dave Matthews
Oh when the world ends
Collect your things
You're coming with me
When the world ends
You tuckle up yourself with me
Watch it as the stars disappear to nothing
The day the world is over
We'll be lying in bed

I'm gonna rock you like a baby when the cities fall
We will rise as the building's crumble
Midst the burning we'll be churning
Love will be our wings
Passion rises from the ashes
When the world ends

When the world ends
You're gonna come with me
We're gonna be crazy like a river bends
We're gonna float through the criss cross of the mountains
Watch them fade to nothin
When the world ends
You know that's what's happenin now
I'm gonna be there with you somehow
Ah ha

I', gonna tie you up like a baby in the carriage car
Your legs don't work cause you want me so 
You just lie spread to the wall
Love you got is surely all the love I would ever need
I'm gonna take you by my side and love you tall till the world ends

Ohhhhhhhhh
But don't you worry about a thing
No cause I got you here with me
Mmmmmmm
Don't you worry about a 
Just you and me
Floating through the empty empty
Just you and me
Oh graces
Oh grace

Oh when the world ends
We'll be burning one Ah
When the world ends
We'll be sweet makin love
Oh you know when the world ends
I'm gonna take you aside and say
Let's watch it fade away fade away

The worlds done
Ours just begun
Ours just begun

We're gonna dive into the emptiness
We be swimming
I'm gonna walk you through the pathless roads
I'm gonna take you to the top of the mountain that's no longer there
I'm gonna take you to bed and love you I swear like the end is here

I'm gonna take you up to
I'm gonna take you down on you
I'm gonna hold you like an angel

I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
When the world ends
I'm gonna hold you
When the world is over
We'll just be beg...

The Space Between
Dave Matthews
You cannot quit me so quickly
Is no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I've got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell to keep us safe from the pain

Will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell that hope to keep us safe from the pain

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a rollercoaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
That's where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between 
Our wicked lies is
The hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
Your heart and mind
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain

The space between
The space between

I Did It
Dave Matthews
I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that will rock the boat will rock
Make a bomb of love and blow it up

I did it
Do you think I've gone too far
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing to 
Change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know at all
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl
I did it justice I just did it for us all

It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done
The truth is that I don't really care
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time
You better lock me up I'll do it again

I did it justice I just did it for the buzz

All you people are the skewers of our dreams
Like the cat that collared me
Oh what I gotta say to you got love don't
Turn it down
Turn it loud
Let it build
We got a long way to go
But you gotta start somewhere
Go door to door spread the love you got
You got the love
You get what you want
Does it matter where you get it from
I for one
Don't turn my cheek for anyone
Unturn your cheek to give your love
Love to grow

Change the ugly ways of the world

Mother Father
Dave Matthews
Mother Father please explain to me
Why a world so full of mystery
A place so bitter and still so sweet
So beautiful and yet so full of sad sad

Mother Father please explain to me
Why forests march to deserts be
While snow capped mountains melt away
What do we tell our babies
What do we say

Mother father please explain to me
How a man who rocks his child to sleep
Yet pulls the trigger on his brother's heart
He digs a hole right to the middle of a storm of hatred

Mother Father please explain to me
How it could be so this world has come to be
A precious balance in between
Such cruelty and such kindness please please

Mother Father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
Unequalled in her blessings oh I see
Unbridled hatred so extreme please tell me

Mother Father please explain to me
How the world has come to be so
Twisted between time and dreams
Oh Mother Father please explain to me

What's all this talk about
All this talk about it
Spinning down down down down down
All this talk about
All these words without
And nothing done

Mother Father do you know
Why one mans belly overflows
Another sleeps in hungers bed
We'd trade our world for a piece of bread

Mother father please explain to me
How this rare worlds come to be
A place so full of color yet overflowing always
In black and white black and white
Drowning in the waters of our

Mother father please explain to me
How the world has come to be 
While still blessed in all the things we see
Such a sad sad home for you and me

Com on
Come on out
Come on out you
Come on out you
Come on out you save yourself
Come on out you
Come on out you
Come on out you
We're taking on water
Taking on water

But we've got the freedom
We've got the freedom

There's no God above
No Hell below
It's here with us
It's up to us
To keep afloat oh

Mother Father please explain to me
How this world has come to be

Grey Street
Dave Matthews
Oh look at how she listens
She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out on to Grey Street

She thinks, “Hey,
How did I come to this?
I dream myself a thousand times around the world,
But I can't get out of this place”

There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

How she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears it doesn't listen
There's still a hope in her it might

She says, “I pray
But they fall on deaf ears,
Am I supposed to take it on myself?
To get out of this place”

There's loneliness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

There's a stranger speaks outside her door
Says take what you can from your dreams
Make them as real as anything
It'd take the work out of the courage

But she says, “Please
There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door,
I live on the corner of Grey Street and the end of the world”

There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It's more like cold blue ice in her heart
She feels like kicking out all the windows 
And setting fire to this life
She could change everything about her using colors bold and bright 
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart
It breaks her heart
To grey

Where Are You Going
Dave Matthews
Where are you going, with your long face pulling down?
Don't hide away, like an ocean
But you can't see, but you can smell
And the sound waves crash down

I am no superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing for sure
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going, where do you go?
Are you looking for answers, to questions under the stars?
If along the way you are growing weary, you can rest with me until a brighter day
It's okay, where are you going, where do you go?

I am no superman
I have no answers for you
I am no hero, oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing for sure
Is where you are, is where I belong
I do know, where you go, is where I want to be

Where are you going, where do you go?
Are you looking for answers, where do you go?

Where are you going?
Where do you go?
Let's go.

You Never Know
Dave Matthews
Sitting still as stone watching - watching
People walking by you wondering why
No one ever stops to talk or thinks about it – if they ever did
What if God shuffled by?

One day we might see 
Doing not a thing
Breathing just to breathe
We might find some reason

But rushing around seems what's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Lying on the roof counting
The stars that fill the sky I wonder if
Someone in the heavens looking back down on me – I'll never know
So much space to believe

Funny when you're small
The moon follows the car
There's no one but you see
Hey, the moon is chasing me

I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there til you're dead
Dream

Walking through the wood
No cares in the world
The world has come to play
She's all mine just for a day

There's not a moment to lose in the game
Don't let the troubles in your head
Steal too much time you'll soon be dead
So play

All fall down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light like a flash
You think you can you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem
Dream little darling dream

Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb



But everyday should be a good day to die
Oh all fall down
It won't be too long now
Every fire dies
I find it hard to explain how I got here
I think I can I think I can
Then again I will falter
Dream little darling dream

Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb

Bartender
Dave Matthews
If I go before I'm old
Oh brother of mine please don't forget me if I go
Bartender please, fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free, after three days in the ground

Oh and if I die before my time
Oh sweet sister of mine please don't regret me if I go
Bartender please, fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free after three days in the ground
Bartender please, fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free after three days in the ground

I'm on bended knee I pray Bartender please
Oh when I was young I didn't think about it,
But now I can't get it out of my mind
I'm on bended knee please father please

Oh if all this gold, should steal my soul away
Oh dear mother of mine, please redirect me if this gold
Bartender you see, this wine that's drinking me
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the devil's tree roots
Deep deep in the ground

Bartender you see, this wine that's drinking me
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the devil's tree roots
Deep deep in the ground
I'm on bended knee I pray Bartender please
I'm on bended knee please mama please
Oh when I was young I didn't think about it,
But now I just want to run and hide
I'm on bended knee Bartender please

Dream Girl
Dave Matthews
I would dig a hole all the way to China
unless of course I was there
Then I'd dig my way home
If by diggin I could steal... the wind from the sails
Of the greedy men who rule the world

Still you're my best friend
And after a good good drunk...you and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a
Dream Girl

I was feeling like a creep
as I watched you asleep
face down in the grass in the park
in the middle of a hot afternoon
Your top was untied and I thought how nice
It'll be to follow the sweat down your spine

You're like my best friend
After a good good drunk...you and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a
Dream Girl


caught by a wave
my back to the ocean
it knocks me off my feet and
just as i find my footing
here you come again
Dream Girl
Dream Girl

American Baby
Dave Matthews
If these walls came crumbling down
Fell so hard to make us lose our faith
From what's left you'd figure it out
still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

Stay beautiful baby
I hope you stay American Baby
American Baby

Nobody's laughing now
God's grace lost and the devil is proud
but I've been walking for a thousand miles
If for one last time I could see you smile

I, I hold hold on to you
You bring me hope I'll see you soon
and if i don't see you whoa
I'm afraid we've lost the way

Stay beautiful baby
I hope you stay American Baby
American Baby

I hold on to you 
You lift me up and always will
I see you in light
Hope I don't get left behind
I hold hold on to you
You bring me hope I'll see you soon
and if i don't see you whoa 
I'm afraid we've lost the way

Stay beautiful baby
I hope you stay American Baby

Stay beautiful baby
I hope you stay American Baby

Hello Again
Dave Matthews
said i've done my share of this 
still hope the lord forgive me my sin
ten years ago down by the lake
i sunk my sweet love
her watery grave
I close my eyes and still see her face
i'd give my soul to take back that day

hello again
it's been too long
too long too long
hello again
You know you got what it is I want
Anyway I'm gonna take it from you
You know you got what it is I want
Anyway you know I'm gonna take it from 

still i make my way there
over and over
I'm gonna see her face 
blown away on that day
yes i am

I'm not worth the flesh on my bones
I am a waste of the air in my lungs
Run far from me
Go and be saved
The Devil, not God runs through my veins

Gonna shoot you up again

You drop me in the water
Lift me out and save my soul

You Might Die Trying
Dave Matthews
To change the world
start with one step
However small
first step is hardest of all
Once you get your gait
you'll be walking tall
You said you never did
cause you might die tryin
cause you might die tryin
cause you

If you close your eyes
because the house is on fire
and think you couldn't move
until the fire dies
The things you never did
cause you might die tryin
cause you might die tryin
you'll be as good as dead
cause you might die tryin
cause you might die tryin

If you give you begin to live
if you give you begin to live
you begin
you get the world
if you give you begin to live
you get the world
you get the world
if you give you begin to live
you might die tryin....
