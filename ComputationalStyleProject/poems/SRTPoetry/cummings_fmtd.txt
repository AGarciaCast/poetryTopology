all in green
Edward Estlin Cummings
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
 
Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the merry deer ran before.
 
Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
the swift red deer
the red rare deer.
 
Four red roebuck at a white water
the cruel bugle sang before.
 
Horn at hip went my love riding
riding the echo down
into the silver dawn.
 
Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the level meadows ran before.
 
Softer be they than slippered sleep
the lean lithe deer
the fleet flown deer.
 
Four fleet does at a gold valley
the famished arrow sang before.
 
Bow at belt went my love riding
riding the mountain down
into the silver dawn.
 
Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the sheer peaks ran before.
 
Paler be they than daunting death
the sleek slim deer
the tall tense deer.
 
Four tall stags at the green mountain
the lucky hunter sang before.
 
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
 
Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
my heart fell dead before.

anyone lived in a pretty how town
Edward Estlin Cummings
anyone lived in a pretty how town
(with up so floating many bells down)
spring summer autumn winter
he sang his didn't he danced his did.
 
Women and men (both little and small)
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain
 
children guessed (but only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
autumn winter spring summer)
that noone loved him more by more
 
when by now and tree by leaf
she laughed his joy she cried his grief
bird by snow and stir by still
anyone's any was all to her
 
someones married their everyones
laughed their cryings and did their dance
(sleep wake hope and then)they
said their nevers they slept their dream
 
stars rain sun moon
(and only the snow can begin to explain
how children are apt to forget to remember
with up so floating many bells down)
 
one day anyone died i guess
(and noone stooped to kiss his face)
busy folk buried them side by side
little by little and was by was
 
all by all and deep by deep
and more by more they dream their sleep
noone and anyone earth by april
with by spirit and if by yes.
 
Women and men (both dong and ding)
summer autumn winter spring
reaped their sowing and went their came
sun moon stars rain

Ballad of the Scholar's Lament
Edward Estlin Cummings
When I have struggled through three hundred years
 of Roman history, and hastened o'er
Some French play-(though I have my private fears
 Of flunking sorely when I take the floor
In class),-when I have steeped my soul in gore
 And Greek, and figured over half a ream
With Algebra, which I do (not) adore,
 How shall I manage to compose a theme?
 
It's well enough to talk of poor and peers,
 And munch the golden apples' shiny core,
And lay a lot of heroes on their biers;-
 While the great Alec, knocking down a score,
Takes out his handkerchief, boohoo-ing, "More!"-
 But harshly I awaken from my dream,
To find a new,-er,-privilege,-in store:
 How shall I manage to compose a theme?
 
After I've swallowed prophecies of seers,
 And trailed Aeneas from the Trojan shore,
Learned how Achilles, after many jeers,
 On piggy Agamemnon got to sore,
And heard how Hercules, Esq., tore
 Around, and swept and dusted with a stream,
There's one last duty,-let's not call it bore,-
 How shall I manage to compose a theme?
 
 Envoi
 
Of what avail is all my mighty lore?
 I beat my breast, I tear my hair, I scream:
"Behold, I have a Herculean chore.
 How shall I manage to compose a theme?"

Fame Speaks
Edward Estlin Cummings
Stand forth,John Keats!  On earth thou knew'st me not;
Steadfast through all the storms of passion,thou,
True to thy muse,and virgin to thy vow;
Resigned,if name with ashes were forgot,
So thou one arrow in the gold had'st shot!
I never placed my laurel on thy brow,
But on thy name I come to lay it now,
When thy bones wither in the earthly plot.
Fame is my name.  I dwell among the clouds,
Being immortal,and the wreath I bring
Itself is Immortality.  The sweets
Of earth I know not,more the pains,but wing
In mine own ether,with the crownéd crowds
Born of the centuries.-Stand forth,John Keats!

I Am A Beggar Always
Edward Estlin Cummings
i am a beggar always
who begs in your mind
 
(slightly smiling, patient, unspeaking
with a sign on his
chest
BLIND)yes i
 
am this person of whom somehow
you are never wholly rid(and who
 
does not ask for more than
just enough dreams to
live on)
           after all, kid
 
you might as well
toss him a few thoughts
 
a little love preferably,
anything which you can't
pass off on other people: for
instance a
plugged promise-
 
the he will maybe (hearing something
fall into his hat)go wandering
after it with fingers;till having
 
found
what was thrown away
                                     himself
taptaptaps out of your brain, hopes, life
to(carefully turning a
corner)never bother you any more

i carry your heart with me
Edward Estlin Cummings
i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
i go you go,my dear; and whatever is done
by only me is your doing,my darling)
                                   i fear
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
 
here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
 
i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)

i have found what you are like
Edward Estlin Cummings
i have found what you are like
the rain
 
        (Who feathers frightened fields
with the superior dust-of-sleep. wields
 
easily the pale club of the wind
and swirled justly souls of flower strike
 
the air in utterable coolness
 
deeds of gren thrilling light
                                       with thinned
newfragile yellows
 
                          lurch and press
--in the woods

And the coolness of your smile is
stirringofbirds between my arms;but
i should rather than anything
have(almost when hugeness will shut
quietly)almost,
                      your kiss

i like my body when it is with your
Edward Estlin Cummings
i like my body when it is with your
body.  It is so quite new a thing.
Muscles better and nerves more.
i like your body.  i like what it does,
i like its hows.  i like to feel the spine
of your body and its bones, and the trembling
-firm-smooth ness and which i will
again and again and again
kiss,  i like kissing this and that of you,
i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz
of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes
over parting flesh ... And eyes big love-crumbs,
 
and possibly i like the thrill
 
of under me you so quite new

i sing of Olaf glad and big
Edward Estlin Cummings
i sing of Olaf glad and big
whose warmest heart recoiled at war:
a conscientious object-or
 
his wellbelovéd colonel (trig
westpointer most succinctly bred)
took erring Olaf soon in hand;
but-though an host of overjoyed
noncoms (first knocking on the head
him) do through icy waters roll
that helplessness which others stroke
with brushes recently employed
anent this muddy toiletbowl,
while kindred intellects evoke
allegiance per blunt instruments-
Olaf (being to all intents
a corpse and wanting any rag
upon what God unto him gave)
responds, without getting annoyed
"I will not kiss your fucking flag"
 
straightaway the silver bird looked grave
(departing hurriedly to shave)
 
but-though all kinds of officers
(a yearning nation's blueeyed pride)
their passive prey did kick and curse
until for wear their clarion
voices and boots were much the worse,
and egged the firstclassprivates on
his rectum wickedly to tease
by means of skillfully applied
bayonets roasted hot with heat-
Olaf (upon what were once knees)
does almost ceaselessly repeat
"there is some shit I will not eat"
 
our president,being of which
assertions duly notified
threw the yellowsonofabitch
into a dungeon,where he died
 
Christ (of His mercy infinite)
i pray to see;and Olaf,too
 
preponderatingly because
unless statistics lie he was
more brave than me:more blond than you

If
Edward Estlin Cummings
If freckles were lovely, and day was night,
And measles were nice and a lie warn't a lie,
    Life would be delight,-
    But things couldn't go right
    For in such a sad plight
I wouldn't be I.
 
If earth was heaven, and now was hence,
And past was present, and false was true,
    There might be some sense
    But I'd be in suspense
    For on such a pretense
You wouldn't be you.
 
If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
    Things would seem fair,-
    Yet they'd all despair,
    For if here was there
We wouldn't be we.

Edward Estlin Cummings
if everything happens that can't be done
(and anything's righter
than books

the stupidest teacher will almost guess
(with a run
skip
around we go yes)
there's nothing as something as one
 
one hasn't a why or because or although
(and buds know better
than books

one's anything old being everything new

forever was never till now
 
now i love you and you love me
(and books are shutter

can be)
and deep in the high that does nothing but fall
(with a shout
each
around we go all)
there's somebody calling who's we
 
we're anything brighter than even the sun
(we're everything greater
than books
might mean)
we're everanything more than believe
(with a spin

we're wonderful one times one

If I have made, my lady, intricate
Edward Estlin Cummings
If I have made, my lady, intricate
imperfect various things chiefly which wrong
your eyes (frailer than most deep dreams are frail)
songs less firm than your body's whitest song
upon my mind - if I have failed to snare
the glance too shy - if through my singing slips
the very skillful strangeness of your smile
the keen primeval silence of your hair
 
- let the world say "his most wise music stole
nothing from death" -
   you will only create
(who are so perfectly alive) my shame:
lady whose profound and fragile lips
the sweet small clumsy feet of April came
 
into the ragged meadow of my soul.
******
if I should sleep with a lady called death... (III)
Edward Estlin Cummings
if I should sleep with a lady called death
get another man with firmer lips `
to take your new mouth in his teeth
(hips pumping pleasure into hips).
 
Seeing how the limp huddling string
of your smile over his body squirms
kissingly, I will bring you  every spring
handfuls of little normal worms.
 
Dress deftly your flesh in stupid stuffs,
phrase the immense weapon of your hair.
Understanding why his eye laughs,
I will bring you every year
 
something which is worth the whole,
an inch of nothing for your soul.

it is at moments after I have dreamed
Edward Estlin Cummings
it is at moments after i have dreamed
of the rare entertainment of your eyes,
when(being fool to fancy)i have deemed
 
with your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;
at moments when the glassy darkness holds
 
the genuine apparition of your smile
(it was through tears always)and silence moulds
such strangeness as was mine a little while;
 
moments when my once more illustrious arms
are filled with fascination,when my breast
wears the intolerant brightness of your charms:
 
one pierced moment whiter than the rest
 
-turning from the tremendous lie of sleep
i watch the roses of the day grow deep.
******
it may not always be so
Edward Estlin Cummings
it may not always be so; and i say
that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch
another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch
his heart, as mine in time not far away;
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know, or such
great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;
 
if this should be, i say if this should be --
you of my heart, send me a little word;
that i may go unto him, and take his hands,
saying, Accept all happiness from me.
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.

my father moved through dooms of love
Edward Estlin Cummings
my father moved through dooms of love
through sames of am through haves of give,
singing each morning out of each night
my father moved through depths of height
 
this motionless forgetful where
turned at his glance to shining here;
that if(so timid air is firm)
under his eyes would stir and squirm
 
newly as from unburied which
floats the first who, his april touch
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots
 
and should some why completely weep
my father's fingers brought her sleep:
vainly no smallest voice might cry
for he could feel the mountains grow.
 
Lifting the valleys of the sea
my father moved through griefs of joy;
praising a forehead called the moon
singing desire into begin
 
joy was his song and joy so pure
a heart of star by him could steer
and pure so now and now so yes
the wrists of twilight would rejoice
 
keen as midsummer's keen beyond
conceiving mind of sun will stand,
so strictly(over utmost him
so hugely)stood my father's dream
 
his flesh was flesh his blood was blood:
no hungry man but wished him food;
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile
uphill to only see him smile.
 
Scorning the pomp of must and shall
my father moved through dooms of feel;
his anger was as right as rain
his pity was as green as grain
 
septembering arms of year extend
less humbly wealth to foe and friend
than he to foolish and to wise
offered immeasurable is
 
proudly and(by octobering flame
beckoned)as earth will downward climb,

so naked for immortal work
his shoulders marched against the dark
 
his sorrow was as true as bread:
no liar looked him in the head;
if every friend became his foe
he'd laugh and build a world with snow.
 
My father moved through theys of we,
singing each new leaf out of each tree
(and every child was sure that spring
danced when she heard my father sing)
 
then let men kill which cannot share,
let blood and flesh be mud and mire,
scheming imagine,passion willed,
freedom a drug that's bought and sold
 
giving to steal and cruel kind,
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind,
to differ a disease of same,
conform the pinnacle of am
 
though dull were all we taste as bright,
bitter all utterly things sweet,
maggoty minus and dumb death
all we inherit,all bequeath
 
and nothing quite so least as truth
-i say though hate were why men breathe-
because my father lived his soul
love is the whole and more than all
******
my love
Edward Estlin Cummings
my love
thy hair is one kingdom
the king whereof is darkness
thy forehead is a flight of flowers
thy head is a quick forest
filled with sleeping birds
thy breasts are swarms of white bees
upon the bough of thy body
thy body to me is April
in those armpits is the approach of spring
thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
of kings
they are the striking of a good minstrel
between them is always a pleasant song
my love
thy head is a casket
of the cool jewel of thy mind
the hair of thy head is one warrior
innocent of defeat
thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
with victory and with trumpets
thy legs are the trees of dreaming
whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness
thy lips are satraps in scarlet
in whose kiss is the combinings of kings
thy wrists
are holy
which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases
of silver
in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes
thy eyes are the betrayal
of bells comprehended through incense

since feeling is first
Edward Estlin Cummings
since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
 
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world
 
my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all the flowers. Don't cry
- the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says
 
we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph
 
and death i think is no parenthesis

Sometimes I Am Alive Because With
Edward Estlin Cummings
sometimes i am alive because with
me her alert treelike body sleeps
which i will feel slowly sharpening
becoming distinct with love slowly,
who in my shoulder sinks sweetly teeth
until we shall attain the Springsmelling
intense large togethercoloured instant
 
the moment pleasantly frightful
 
when, her mouth suddenly rising, wholly
begins with mine fiercely to fool
(and from my thighs which shrug and pant
a murdering rain leapingly reaches the upward singular deepest flower which she
carries in a gesture of her hips)
******
somewhere i have never travelled
Edward Estlin Cummings
somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
any experience,your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
 
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose
 
or if your wish be to close me,i and
my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
 
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
compels me with the color of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing
 
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens;only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands

Spring is like a perhaps hand
Edward Estlin Cummings
Spring is like a perhaps hand
(which comes carefully
out of Nowhere)arranging
a window,into which people look(while
people stare
arranging and changing placing
carefully there a strange
thing and a known thing here)and
 
changing everything carefully
 
spring is like a perhaps
Hand in a window
(carefully to
and fro moving New and
Old things,while
people stare carefully
moving a perhaps
fraction of flower here placing
an inch of air there)and
 
without breaking anything.

Edward Estlin Cummings
there are so many tictoc
   clocks everywhere telling people
   what toctic time it is for
   tictic instance five toc minutes toc
   past six tic
 
   Spring is not regulated and does
   not get out of order nor do
   its hands a little jerking move
   over numbers slowly
 
   we do not
   wind it up it has no weights
   springs wheels inside of
   its slender self no indeed dear
   nothing of the kind.
 
   (So,when kiss Spring comes
   we'll kiss each kiss other on kiss the kiss
   lips because tic clocks toc don't make
   a toctic difference
   to kisskiss you and to
   kiss me)

Edward Estlin Cummings
this(let's remember)day died again and
again;whose golden,crimson dooms conceive
 
an oceaning abyss of orange dream
 
larger than sky times earth:a flame beyond
soul immemorially forevering am-
and as collapsing that grey mind by wave
doom disappeared,out of perhaps(who knows?)
 
eternity floated a blossoming
 
(while anyone might slowly count to soon)
rose-did you see her?darling,did you(kiss
me)quickly count to never?you were wrong
 
-then all the way from perfect nowhere came
 
(as easily as we forget something)
livingest the imaginable moon
******
what if a much of a which of a wind
Edward Estlin Cummings
what if a much of a which of a wind
gives the truth to summer's lie;
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun
and yanks immortal stars awry?
Blow king to beggar and queen to seem
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time)
-when skies are hanged and oceans drowned,
the single secret will still be man
 
what if a keen of a lean wind flays
screaming hills with sleet and snow:
strangles valleys by ropes of thing
and stifles forests in white ago?
Blow hope to terror; blow seeing to blind
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind)
-whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees,
it's they shall cry hello to the spring
 
what if a dawn of a doom of a dream
bites this universe in two,
peels forever out of his grave
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you?
Blow soon to never and never to twice
(blow life to isn't:blow death to was)
-all nothing's only our hugest home;
the most who die, the more we live
******
when serpents bargain
Edward Estlin Cummings
when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage -
when thorns regard their roses with alarm
and rainbows are insured against old age
 
when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
- and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close
 
when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn - valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude - and march
denounces april as a saboteur
 
then we'll believe in that incredible
unanimal mankind (and not until)
******
Where's Madge then,
Edward Estlin Cummings
Where's Madge then,
Madge and her men?
buried with
Alice in her hair,
(but if you ask the rain
he'll not tell where.)
 
beauty makes terms
with time and his worms,
when loveliness
says sweetly Yes
to wind and cold;
and how much earth
is Madge worth?
Inquire of the flower that sways in the autumn
she will never guess.
but i know
 
my heart fell dead before.

Young Woman of Cambridge,
Edward Estlin Cummings
"Gay" is the captivating cognomen of a Young Woman of cambridge,
   mass.
to whom nobody seems to have mentioned ye olde freudian wish;
when i contemplate her uneyes safely ensconced in thick glass
you try if we are a gentleman not to think of(sh)
 
the world renowned investigator of paper sailors--argonauta argo
harmoniously being with his probably most brilliant pupil mated,
let us not deem it miraculous if their(so to speak)offspring has that largo
appearance of somebody who was hectocotyliferously propagated
 
when Miss G touched n.y. our skeleton stepped from his cupboard
gallantly offering to demonstrate the biggest best busiest city
and presently found himself rattling for that well known suburb
the bronx(enlivening an otherwise dead silence with harmless quips, out
   of Briggs by Kitty)
 
arriving in an exhausted condition, i purchased two bags of lukewarm
   peanuts
with the dime which her mama had generously provided(despite courte-
   ous protestations)
and offering Miss Gay one(which she politely refused)set out gaily for
   the hyenas
suppressing my frank qualms in deference to her not inobvious perturba-
   tions
 
unhappily, the denizens of the zoo were that day inclined to be uncouthly
   erotic
more particularly the primates--from which with dignity square feet
   turned abruptly Miss Gay away:
"on the whole"(if you will permit a metaphor savouring slightly of the
   demotic)
Miss Gay had nothing to say to the animals and the animals had nothing
   to say to Miss Gay
 
during our return voyage, my pensive companion dimly remarlted some-
   thing about "stuffed
fauna" being "very interesting" . . . we also discussed the possibility of
   rain. . .
E distant proximity to a Y.W.c.a. she suddenly luffed
--thanking me; and(stating that she hoped we might "meet again
sometime")vanished, gunwale awash. I thereupon loosened my collar
and dove for the nearest l; surreptitiously cogitating
the dictum of a new england sculptor(well on in life)re the helen moller
dancers, whom he considered "elevating--that is, if dancing CAN be ele-
   vating"
 
Miss(believe it or)Gay is a certain Young Woman unacquainted with the
   libido
and pursuing a course of instruction at radcliffe college, cambridge, mass.
i try if you are a gentleman not to sense something un poco putrido
when we contemplate her uneyes safely ensconced in thick glass
