"Arcturus" is his other name
Emily Dickinson
"Arcturus" is his other name--
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
 
I slew a worm the other day--
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"--"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord--how frail are we"!
 
I pull a flower from the woods--
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath--
And has her in a "class"!
 
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat--
He sits erect in "Cabinets"--
The Clover bells forgot.
 
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now--
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
 
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"--
Whatever prank betides!
 
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed--
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come--
And laugh at me--and stare--
 
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl--
Old fashioned--naught--everything--
Over the stile of "Pearl."

"Heaven" has different Signs--to me
Emily Dickinson
"Heaven" has different Signs--to me--
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place--
And when again, at Dawn,
 
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills--
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals--
 
The Orchard, when the Sun is on--
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make--
Some Carnivals of Clouds--
 
The Rapture of a finished Day--
Returning to the West--
All these--remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"--
 
Itself be fairer--we suppose--
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace--
Not yet, our eyes can see--

"Heaven"--is what I cannot reach!
Emily Dickinson
"Heaven"--is what I cannot reach!
The Apple on the Tree--
Provided it do hopeless--hang--
That--"Heaven" is--to Me!
 
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud--
The interdicted Land--
Behind the Hill--the House behind--
There--Paradise--is found!
 
Her teasing Purples--Afternoons--
The credulous--decoy--
Enamored--of the Conjuror--
That spurned us--Yesterday!

"Hope" is the thing with feathers
Emily Dickinson
"Hope" is the thing with feathers--
That perches in the soul--
And sings the tune without the words--
And never stops--at all--
 
And sweetest--in the Gale--is heard--
And sore must be the storm--
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm--
 
I've heard it in the chillest land--
And on the strangest Sea--
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb--of Me.

Could the Children find the way there--
Some, would even trudge tonight!

Wherefore it shut--when He was by--
Because He knows it cannot speak--

A Bird came down the Walk
Emily Dickinson
A Bird came down the Walk--
He did not know I saw--
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,
 
And then he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass--
 
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroa--
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought--
He stirred his velvet head
 
Like one in danger, Cautious,
I offered him a Crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home--
 
Than Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seam--
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,
Leap, plashless as they swim.

With a glance and a Bow

Lost doubly, but by contrast most,

A drop fell on the apple tree

A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.
 
A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!
 
The dust replaced in hoisted roa
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.
 
The breezes brought dejected
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.

From which he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passer-by!

But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence--
And struts in sewing silk!
 
Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!

By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly!

A light exists in spring
Emily Dickinson
A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period.
When March is scarcely here
 
A color stands abroad
On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
But human naturefeels.
 
It waits upon the lawn;
It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
It almost speaks to me.
 
Then, as horizons step,
Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
It passes, and we stay:
 
A quality of loss
Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a sacrament.

Occasionally rides;
You may have met him,--did you not,
His notice sudden is.
 
The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.
 
He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,
 
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun,--
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.
 
Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;
 
But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone.

A privilege--I think--
 
His venerable Hand to take--
And warming in our own--
A passage back--or two--to make--
To Times when he--was young--
 
His quaint opinions--to inspect--
His thought to ascertain
On Themes concern our mutual mind--
The Literature of Man--
 
What interested Scholars--most--
What Competitions ran--
When Plato--was a Certainty--
And Sophocles--a Man--
 
When Sappho--was a living Girl--
And Beatrice wore
The Gown that Dante--deified--
Facts Centuries before
 
He traverses--familiar--
As One should come to Town--
And tell you all your Dreams--were true--
He lived--where Dreams were born--
 
His presence is Enchantment--
You beg him not to go--
Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads
And tantalize--just so--

A Prison gets to be a friend
Emily Dickinson
A Prison gets to be a friend--
Between its Ponderous face
And Ours--a Kinsmanship express--
And in its narrow Eyes--
 
We come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us--stated as our food--
And hungered for--the same--
 
We learn to know the Planks--
That answer to Our feet--
So miserable a sound--at first--
Nor ever now--so sweet--
 
As plashing in the Pools--
When Memory was a Boy--
But a Demurer Circuit--
A Geometric Joy--
 
The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor--Not so real
The Check of Liberty--
 
As this Phantasm Steel--
Whose features--Day and Night--
Are present to us--as Our Own--
And as escapeless--quite--
 
The narrow Round--the Stint--
The slow exchange of Hope--
For something passiver--Content
Too steep for lookinp up--
 
The Liberty we knew
Avoided--like a Dream--
Too wide for any Night but Heaven--
If That--indeed--redeem--

A Route of Evanescence
Emily Dickinson

A science--so the Savants say,
"Comparative Anatomy"--

Of some rare tenant of the mold,

This meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly!

A single Screw of Flesh
Emily Dickinson

That stands for Deity, to Mine,
Upon my side the Veil--
 
Once witnessed of the Gauze--
Its name is put away
As far from mine, as if no plight
Had printed yesterday,
 
In tender--solemn Alphabet,
My eyes just turned to see,
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity--
 
More Hands--to hold--These are but Two--
One more new-mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril's sake--
Some striding--Giant--Love--
 
So greater than the Gods can show,
They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let its Keepsake--go

A Solemn thing within the Soul
Emily Dickinson

 
A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe--
And golden hang--while farther up--
The Maker's Ladders stop--
And in the Orchard far below--
You hear a Being--drop--
 
A Wonderful--to feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished--
Cool of eye, and critical of Work--
He shifts the stem--a little--
To give your Core--a look--
 
But solemnest--to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer--Every Sun
The Single--to some lives.

Emily Dickinson

 
A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.
 
A something in a summer's noon--
A depth--an Azure--a perfume--
Transcending ecstasy.
 
And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see--
 
Then veil my too inspecting face
Lets such a subtle--shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me--
 
The wizard fingers never rest--
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it narrow bed--
 
Still rears the East her amber Flag--
Guides still the sun along the Crag
His Caravan of Red--
 
So looking on--the night--the morn
Conclude the wonder gay--
And I meet, coming thro' the dews
Another summer's Day!

Recollect the way,--
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory.

Ample make this Bed
Emily Dickinson

 
Ample make this Bed--
Make this Bed with Awe--
In it wait till Judgment break
Excellent and Fair.
 
Be its Mattress straight--
Be its Pillow round--
Let no Sunrise' yellow noise
Interrupt this Ground--

An altered look about the hills
Emily Dickinson

 
An altered look about the hills--
A Tyrian light the village fills--
A wider sunrise in the morn--
A deeper twilight on the lawn--
A print of a vermillion foot--
A purple finger on the slope--
A flippant fly upon the pane--
A spider at his trade again--
An added strut in Chanticleer--
A flower expected everywhere--
An axe shrill singing in the woods--
Fern odors on untravelled roads--
All this and more I cannot tell--
A furtive look you know as well--
And Nicodemus' Mystery
Receives its annual reply!

An awful Tempest mashed the air
Emily Dickinson

 
An awful Tempest mashed the air--
The clouds were gaunt, and few--
A Black--as of a Spectre's Cloak
Hid Heaven and Earth from view.
 
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs--
And whistled in the air--
And shook their fists--
And gnashed their teeth--
And swung their frenzied hair.
 
The morning lit--the Birds arose--
The Monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast--
And peace--was Paradise!

An English Breeze
Emily Dickinson
UP with the sun, the breeze arose,
Across the talking corn she goes,
And smooth she rustles far and wide
Through all the voiceful countryside.
 
Through all the land her tale she tells;
She spins, she tosses, she compels
The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails
And all the trees in all the dales.
 
God calls us, and the day prepares
With nimble, gay and gracious airs:
And from Penzance to Maidenhead
The roads last night He watered.
 
God calls us from inglorious ease,
Forth and to travel with the breeze
While, swift and singing, smooth and strong
She gallops by the fields along.

And when the solemn features
Confirm--in Victory--
We start--as if detected
In Immortality--

And this of all my Hopes
Emily Dickinson

 
And this of all my Hopes
This, is the silent end
Bountiful colored, my Morning rose
Early and sere, its end
 
Never Bud from a Stem
Stepped with so gay a Foot
Never a Worm so confident
Bored at so brave a Root

Angels, in the early morning
Emily Dickinson

 
Angels, in the early morning
May be seen the Dews among,
Stooping--plucking--smiling--flying--
Do the Buds to them belong?
 
Angels, when the sun is hottest
May be seen the sands among,
Stooping--plucking--sighing--flying--
Parched the flowers they bear along.

Apparently with no Surprise
Emily Dickinson
Apparently with no surprise,
To any happy flower,
The frost beheads it at its play,
In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on.
The sun proceeds unmoved,
To measure off another day,
For an approving God.

Arcturus
Emily Dickinson
"Arcturus" is his other name--
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
 
I slew a worm the other day--
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"--"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord--how frail are we"!
 
I pull a flower from the woods--
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath--
And has her in a "class"!
 
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat--
He sits erect in "Cabinets"--
The Clover bells forgot.
 
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now--
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
 
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"--
Whatever prank betides!
 
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed--
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come--
And laugh at me--and stare--
 
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl--
Old fashioned--naught--everything--
Over the stile of "Pearl."

As by the dead we love to sit
Emily Dickinson

 
As by the dead we love to sit,

In broken mathematics

Vast--in its fading ration
To our penurious eyes!

As Children bid the Guest "Good Night"
Emily Dickinson

 
As Children bid the Guest "Good Night"
And then reluctant turn--
My flowers raise their pretty lips--
Then put their nightgowns on.

Merry that it is Morn--
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Will peep, and prance again.

Emily Dickinson

 
As far from pity, as complaint--
As cool to speech--as stone--
As numb to Revelation
As if my Trade were Bone--
 
As far from time--as History--
As near yourself--Today--
As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf--
Or Sunset's Yellow play
 
To eyelids in the Sepulchre--
How dumb the Dancer lies--
While Color's Revelations break--
And blaze--the Butterflies!

As Frost is best conceived
Emily Dickinson

 
As Frost is best conceived
By force of its Result--
Affliction is inferred
By subsequent effect--
 
If when the sun reveal,
The Garden keep the Gash--
If as the Days resume
The wilted countenance
 
Cannot correct the crease
Or counteract the stain--
Presumption is Vitality
Was somewhere put in twain.

Emily Dickinson

 
As if I asked a common Alms,

And I, bewildered, stand--

And it should lift its purple Dikes,
And shatter me with Dawn!

As if some little Arctic flower
Emily Dickinson

 
As if some little Arctic flower
Upon the polar hem--
Went wandering down the Latitudes
Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer--
To firmaments of sun--
To strange, bright crowds of flowers--
And birds, of foreign tongue!
I say, As if this little flower
To Eden, wandered in--
What then? Why nothing,
Only, your inference therefrom!

As if the Sea should part
Emily Dickinson

 
As if the Sea should part
And show a further Sea--

Of Periods of Seas--

Themselves the Verge of Seas to be--
Eternity--is Those--

As imperceptibly as Grief
Emily Dickinson

 
As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away--
Too imperceptible at last
To seem like Perfidy--
A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun,
Or Nature spending with herself
Sequestered Afternoon--
The Dusk drew earlier in--
The Morning foreign shone--
A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,
As Guest, that would be gone--
And thus, without a Wing
Or service of a Keel
Our Summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful.

As One does Sickness over
Emily Dickinson

 
As One does Sickness over
In convalescent Mind,
His scrutiny of Chances
By blessed Health obscured--
 
As One rewalks a Precipice
And whittles at the Twig
That held Him from Perdition
Sown sidewise in the Crag
 
A Custom of the Soul
Far after suffering
Identity to question
For evidence't has been--

As plan for Noon and plan for Night
Emily Dickinson

 
As plan for Noon and plan for Night
So differ Life and Death
In positive Prospective--
The Foot upon the Earth
 
At Distance, and Achievement, strains,
The Foot upon the Grave
Makes effort at conclusion
Assisted faint of Love.

As Sleigh Bells seem in summer
Emily Dickinson

Or Bees, at Christmas show--

Repealed from observation--
A Party that we knew--

As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies
Emily Dickinson

 
As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies
As the Vulture teased
Forces the Broods in lonely Valleys
As the Tiger eased
 
By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet
Till he meet a Man
Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues
And partakes--his Tongue
 
Cooled by the Morsel for a moment
Grows a fiercer thing
Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa
A Nutrition mean
 
I, of a finer Famine
Deem my Supper dry
For but a Berry of Domingo
And a Torrid Eye.

As Watchers hang upon the East
Emily Dickinson

 
As Watchers hang upon the East,
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory Fancy spread--
As brooks in deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delight,
Heaven beguiles the tired.
 
As that same watcher, when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go--
That Beggar, when an honored Guest,
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,
Heaven to us, if true.

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine
Emily Dickinson

 
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!
 
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower--
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum--
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

As Children, who remain in Face
The more their Feet retire.

Flits Steam.

Because I could not stop for Death
Emily Dickinson
Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
 
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.
 
We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of grazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
 
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.
 
Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.

Without her diadem.
