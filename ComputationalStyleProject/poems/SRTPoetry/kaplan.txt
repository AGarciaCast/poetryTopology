Melvin the Moose
Dave Kaplan
Melvin the Moose was a friend of mine
When I was a child
He's the funniest darn moose
That you'll ever meet
He'd tell jokes, leave me rolling on the floor
I had no idea just how funny
A moose could be
 
But then it dawned on me he must
Just have good writers
He looked at me and winked
And then just disappeared
 
 
I knew a girl named Sara when
I was a boy aged ten
She was the prettiest (little) girl
That I'll ever see
She'd smile at me, then hide her brown
Eyes with brown hair
She showed me just how irresistible
A girl can be
 
But then I tried to capture her
Spirit for my own
I looked at her and winked
And then she disappeared
 
 
I knew myself back a while
When strangers still smiled
I was the greatest person
Who lived in me
I'd give myself good advice
And unconditional love
I had no idea just how light
One soul could be
 
But then I launched me rEally
High up in the air
I looked like a star and twinkled
And then I disappeared...
 
 
Like confetti
I fluttered down softly
And like a song
I stuck in people's heads
Like police
I search others for a piece
Of myself
And look where all of this has led...

Another
Dave Kaplan
Another night in bed and I can't sleep
Put my head on my pillow and I counted sheep
Turned on my music soft to help me dream
Billowed in to my soul's sail and made me serene
The music's in my head and we become one
Sail away, it will stay until its job is done
But then you come along into my mind
And it's you that keeps me up late the most I find
 
Imagine me and you in view tonight
But not soon because we'll be still a lengthy flight
Open the door to you and hug ya tight
Slide my hands down your back side and touch our lips light
Now you're stuck in my head and we become one
What the hell, while you're there well we should have some fun
But then I reach to you and you're not there
What I feel: just the air though I know we both care
 
Don't want to leave these warm blankets
For the cold floor
And I'm not leaving these warm thoughts
Unless you're at the door
But now it's coming down
Just to this
But then I'd come around
For something not to miss
 
In spite of knowing truth I'm still confused
See it's true, nothing I can do but win or lose
A romance best I've seen oh what a chance
Happenstance, we were dancing and I met your glance
So close and yet so far it's all too true
I can't help thinking we would be the perfect two
I know I'm crazy but it feels so right
Inner light and you heat me from inside tonight

Don't want to leave these warm blankets
For the cold floor
And I'm not leaving these warm thoughts
Unless you're at the door
But now it's coming down
Just to this
But then I'd come around
For something not to miss
 
And often I wonder
Will we get our chance together?
Or will our love remain in our separate hearts, forever?
When I think about seeing you again
I wonder if you think about seeing me too
‘Cause when I do, and when we do, and I have you, that's when I'll prove
With me you move and we glide so smooth down the highway to a beautiful life
Yeah yeah, yeah
We're just walking down this road, walking down this road
looking at everything, yeah
and we'll be, okay, someday, we'll be okay someday
any day now, every single day
‘cause that's just the way it'll be
that's just the way it will be

Walking Around
Dave Kaplan
He is walking by the waves on the golden shore
Shoes off, mind off, feeling quite lost
As he peers across the ocean that has no end
It's a feeling he gets that he'll be here again
 
Give me all the sun and the sand you have
Lift my spirits up to the sky
We can always pretend our world's a drag
Why do we feel the need to lie
 
A coconut (crash) hits him on his head
He's down, he's out now for the count
Not dead but dreaming of this place
And a smile lightens up his face
 
Give me all the sun and the sand you have
Lift my spirits up to the sky
We can always pretend our world's a drag
Why do we feel the need to lie down
 
Walter waltzes with his women wearing wet skin
Dancing down the day-to-day demanding dark begin
This fellow's folly falls in failing finding fun tonight
The walrus warns to walk away or 'ware the oysters' plight

Give me all the sun and the sand you have
Lift my spirits up to the sky
We can always pretend our world's a drag
Why do we feel the need to lie down
In the sand
Lie down in the sand, lie down in the sand

We are walking by the waves on the golden shore
Shoes on, mind on, feeling quite gone
As we peer across the ocean that has no end
It's the feeling that we have that we're here again

One Life To Love
Dave Kaplan
I don't know how people can take it
Seeing the crimes on TV
I don't know how people can make them
Feeling apart is a tragedy
We just have lost two little girls
And one man is trying to flee
What can I do but cry for the world
Silently hope it never happens to me
Just turn away...and pray...but I know
 
We're all in this together
But I don't think people understand that
When they see each other
We're all dancing to the same band
Can't you feel the pain of a sick lady
Inside your heart is torn
Don't you feel the joy of a baby
Inside your heart is reborn
 
You see people shoot their brother
Just because he got more on his plate
We only get one life to love
Don't waste it all consumed with hate
There's so much difference you can make
Oh oh...

It's not how much you have it's how much you give
To the people in the world where you will grow
Take all of the people in the town in which you live
Hold on, hold on, and let go

We're all in this together
But I don't think people understand that
When they see each other
We're all dancing to the same band
Can't you feel the pain of a sick lady
Inside your heart is torn
Don't you feel the joy of a baby
Inside your heart is reborn

A Song
Dave Kaplan
I've been living here so long, never knew it was there
Been having a good time so far, it's nice all the time, but I
Needed a change, to help me understand just how
Lucky I am
 
Everybody needs a little sour to make the sweetness taste so sweet and
Everybody needs a little pain to gain a comprehension of feeling good
There's nothing like that warm cup of cider that my mom made me after I played in the rain, no
It was so good, I felt so good
 
Looking in the water from this mountain cliff view
I see in the ocean pieces of the sky's blues that have
Fallen down
Thinking 'bout these moments and what makes them beautiful
I turn to see just who can make them real and it's
All of you
Laying back my head against the car-seat headrest
I feel the sea air fill up the space in my chest and I
Close my eyes
Dreaming all these crazy dreams where nothing's what it seems
I fly away to go and save the day before
It's too late
 
You know they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, well it's true
We wouldn't have the light if it were never dark
Yeah and we wouldn't have Friday nights if there were no week to end
How could we see anything without anything else?
It would just be all the same all the time, all the same baby
 
Everybody needs a little sour to make the sweetness taste so sweet and
Everybody needs a little pain to gain a comprehension of feeling good
There's nothing like that warm cup of cider that my mom made me after I played in the rain, no
It was so good, I felt so good
 
Looking in the water from this mountain cliff view
I see in the ocean pieces of the sky's blues that have
Fallen down
Thinking 'bout these moments and what makes them beautiful
I turn to see just who can make them real and it's
All of you
Laying back my head against the car-seat headrest
I feel the sea air fill up the space in my chest and I
Close my eyes
Dreaming all these crazy dreams where nothing's what it seems
I fly away to go and save the day before
It's too late
 
Everybody needs a little sour to make the sweetness taste so sweet and

One For The Road
Dave Kaplan
As we drove across the ocean
Waves lapping up at our sides, you said:
Full speed ahead or we'll sink sure
Faster, faster, just skimming the top.
 
Well I don't like the looks of this
And it looks like something's amiss
 
As we drove right through the fields
Blue and yellow sea of flowers
You kept straight ahead, never saw:
Saw where we were or who we are
 
Well I don't like the looks of this
And it looks like something's amiss
Let's just pull over for a kiss
 
Sometimes I just feel like
Getting wrapped up in the comfort of the world
Go laugh with the fish
Roll around in poppies with a girl
 
As we did what we've done before
Goin' around and around and around ("and around") (each other)
I got sick, so I lay in a field to rest myself
But the vultures above kept going ‘round and ‘round
 
Well I don't like the looks of this
And it looks like something's amiss
  
As I looked around my cave
I can't help but hate some things around me
Can't help loving things taken far from me
Cave wall paintings of blue trust surround me
 
And in the corner, bats rustle and we run away

Well I don't like the looks of this
And it looks like something's amiss
Let's just pull over for a kiss

Sometimes I just feel like
Getting wrapped up in the comfort of the world
Go laugh with the fish
Roll around in poppies with a girl
 
And as we walk the aisle to the rest of our lives
Flower petals at our feet and children by our side
You say you see the end of the tunnel and there's no light:
Just death,
Yeah but this whole tunnel's flowing with bright life
 
Well I just love the looks of this
And it looks like eternal bliss
Let's just pull over for a kiss

Sometimes I just feel like
Getting wrapped up in the comfort of the world
Go laugh with the fish
Roll around in poppies with a girl

Too Fast
Dave Kaplan
It always starts a little...
Slow,
You start, unsure, you don't know
Who's it gonna be, wouldja dance with me
Or could we talk about it better not here but in a letter, Or
Can we just jump and fall, rise again
Turn down the lights and it'll be alright babe
Pretend we never saw and see what we've been
Missing...
Yeah see what we had
And didn't know
 
Start back a little
Then come into my heart
Back up a little
That was just a false
Start to believe
 
Now it's all lost, I'm lost, it's gone forever
With the touch, the feel that we got lost in:
The music swept through us, the people never knew us
The day was reborn, the night it made a new us
And I wish upon the stars and my Milky Way bars,
That that place with that yard and those cars, were all ours
But they're not
So I see what I have
And I don't know

Start back a little
Then come into my heart
Back up a little
That was just a false-
Start to believe

...but it goes by too fast

******
Time To Go Home
Dave Kaplan
And when it comes

we've been waiting

holding our breaths for way too long
it's been months and months of going along with
this

well I never wanted a thing to end
and you told me it's all the same and then
this
 
The tree outside my window is full in bloom
I can't fall asleep cuz it's hot in my bed
Maybe some day you'll regret the classes you cut, but for now
All that remains is the 'so what'
 
I can't wait

to come back

we'll be dancing on the water and be swimmin' our song
and playing games on my front lawn like
this

scolding ourselves in the past
praying that we can last and last and
last

The tree outside my window is full in bloom
I can't fall asleep cuz it's hot in my bed
Maybe some day you'll regret the classes you cut, but for now
All that remains is the 'so what'
 
Now the ground is strewn with fragrant petals
The miners have gathered their precious stones
I'm leaving for the airport in just three hours, but for now
All that remains is

******
Just Flying
Dave Kaplan
I've been coming up for a while now
Always looking up, don't understand why everybody looks down
I see trees and roofs against a blue sky
Better than the ground, can't understand why you'd just look where you lie
 
Well things are good, they're great, they couldn't be better
Snow is on the ground, (and) I'm in a place where people are my weather
Sometimes their tears soak me like rain
But I know we know, it'll dry soon and love will shine again
 
Everything looks like toys from up high
And even down there sometimes you can't trust your eyes
But it's beautiful:
It's the first girl you kissed beneath the summer sky
It's beautiful...
The friends now gone for whom you're not afraid to cry
 
I can see it start to come down
Always happens soon, I just hope that soon time isn't now
Like taffy bonds stretch out and get real thin
Try to get it back, push don't pull but they just won't fold back in
 
Everything looks like toys from up high
And even down there sometimes you can't trust your eyes
But it's beautiful:
It's the first girl you kissed beneath the summer sky
It's beautiful...
The friends now gone for whom you're not afraid to cry

Everything looks like toys from up high
And even down there sometimes you can't trust your eyes
But it's beautiful:
It's the first girl you kissed beneath the summer sky
It's beautiful...
The friends now gone for whom you're not afraid to cry
 
And it's so beautiful:
I could kiss you all day long
Because you're so beautiful
I've known this all along

******
Same Difference
Dave Kaplan
Well it's funny, they say you can't go home again
But here I am
Staying up after my parents have gone to bed
Guitar in hand
 
Funny how it's all still the same way
But it looks different than last time
Everything is still of its old shape
The changing here is all mine
 
I've gone swimming twice since I've got back
I love water's touch
It's been so long since I've been in a pool
I missed it so much
 
I used to get so annoyed at some people, they
Just were too much to take
But now I feel a love for everybody and
It sure beats being fake
 
Funny how it's all still the same way
But it looks different than last time
Everything is still of its old shape
The changing here is all mine
 
******
Still Going Back
Dave Kaplan
She rushed into the room,
Said Tell me why I'm crying
I asked babe what's wrong; she told me:
When best friends leave, it feels like dying
Well I
know...I know
 
It's alright, we'll see them soon
If not this minute then maybe in June
And if not in June, then in our hearts
They remind us of the best parts
Of life
 
As we sit here on this bed
You say you'll miss him when he's gone
I'll miss him too you know
Remember it's not wrong
To love...someone

It's alright, we'll see them soon
If not this minute then maybe in June
And if not in June, then in our hearts
They remind us of the best parts
Of life
 
Now the rooms are empty
Where once we filled them with the meaning of life
And all the halls and our walls are just bare
They're just squares of cinderblock hanging in air
My arms are still sore from carrying boxes
Out the window cars pull away
Everybody is still going back, but me
Nowhere to be but here, to stay

******
Next Week
Dave Kaplan
It's always next week, always not this time
It's finding ways to keep your dreams in the sky
Let's go right now, down to New Orleans
We'll pretend that we're the king and queen
And smile
 
I remember you told me
Make sure we hang out this June
Too often people make plans
But in the end they all fall through
 
They ask me if I want to go to the moon
They ask me do I want to dance on the sea
They tell me that we'll drive to Australia
Then leave me to watch crocs on TV
 
It's always next week, always not this time
It's finding ways to keep your dreams in the sky
Let's go right now, down to New Orleans
We'll pretend that we're the king and queen
And smile
 
And as I listened to your voice
In my head what you said rang true
There's so much talk about talk, but
Look around, in life, it's what you do
 
They ask me if I want to go to the moon
They ask me do I want to dance on the sea
They tell me that we'll drive to Australia
Then leave me to watch crocs on TV
 
It's always next week, always not this time
It's finding ways to keep your dreams in the sky
Let's go right now, down to New Orleans
We'll pretend that we're the king and queen
And smile

Driveway Time
Dave Kaplan
It all started one night back in high school
Ever so inconspicuously
Instead of going home to bed we stayed in the driveway, talking,
Yeah just him and me
Well I was freezing it was dark and I was needing to sleep,
But wanting to talk
For some reason those conditions made me speak my mind
It was no sidewalk, no it was
 
Driveway time
Counting minutes that become hours
Driveway time
As the night turns into day
Driveway time
Talking about what really matters
Driveway time
We're coming home the long way
 
We started keeping track of driveway time among our
Little group of friends
Just like a contest
To see who could stay the longest
Who won? Well, that depends…
If your idea of quality time starts when all the bustle is gone
And what's for you is what is true and simple
Then it's for you, and so is this song, and so is something else,
Do you know what? Because I do, and it's real down to earth, and so is:

Driveway time
Counting minutes that become hours
Driveway time
As the night turns into day
Driveway time
Talking about what really matters
Driveway time
We're coming home the long way
 
Driveway time
Counting minutes that become hours
Driveway time
As the night turns into day
Driveway time
Talking about what really matters
Driveway time
We're coming home the long way

Wonderful (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
I sit looking at my family
Got 5 generations right next to me
And I wonder
Mammaw at 100 still far from weak
And Mackenzie on the floor learning how to speak
Oh what a wonder
 
Looking out the 21st floor window
On the city of San Antonio
Watching the Spurs win an NBA crown
Hearing Tim McGraw set this circus down
 
It's been three days of meeting my tribe
Didn't know there were so many kinfolk of mine
They didn't know that I exist
But when I left we all hugged and kissed
 
I saw my second cousin hadn't seen since I was 5
I saw how great a thing it was to feel to be alive

I sit looking at my family
Got 5 generations right next to me
And I wonder
Mammaw at 100 still far from weak
And Mackenzie on the floor learning how to speak
Oh what a wonder
  
We started out seeing my great aunt Esther
Still living in Cuero where her parents raised her
I couldn't dream of never leaving town
But still it's majestic how she stays her ground
 
We found the house my mom grew up in
The small backyard they kept their pup in
Down the street was Mom's old school
Further down the old public pool
 
Maybe someday I'll show my kids the house where I was raised
Maybe someday I'll show them where I went to 7th grade

I sit looking at my family
Got 5 generations right next to me
And I wonder
Mammaw at 100 still far from weak
And Mackenzie on the floor learning how to speak
Oh what a wonder
 
I look and I see
So many stories I don't know 
I look and I see
Another place I could call home 
I look and I see
People telling me I look like their own

Hot One (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
It's gonna be a hot one
Going down to Texas
Getting burned on my skin from the heat of the sun
The chili burning holes in the tip of my tongue
It's gonna be a hot one
 
I'm flying down right now to San Antonio
The riverwalk city with the Alamodome
Gonna drive to my great aunt down in Cuero
Seeing fields of bluebonnets as we go
 
The big day is the following Tuesday
To celebrate Mammaw's 100th birthday
I haven't seen her since I was a boy
Seeing her we'll be overjoyed
 
It's gonna be a hot one
Going down to Texas
Getting burned on my skin from the heat of the sun
The chili burning holes in the tip of my tongue
It's gonna be a hot one
  
I'm thinking about when I'm older
I'd rather live somewhere warmer than colder
Start a family of my very own
Maybe in a century see my great-grandkids come home

Sparkle (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
Well we were driving on a glowing autumn day
Up through the downtown we went, sunlight pave the way
Through the window flooded houses cars and stores
Behind each different façade there lay so much more
 
No matter how much I see
There will always be some more in this world for me
No matter who the people I know
We will always have a good time when we're taking it slow
 
Just think about your own life, how much you've gone through
And when you look around it's hundreds times new you's
The cows graze in the field, the lights sparkle the tower
And babies smile for the first time by thousands every hour
 
No matter how much I see
There will always be some more in this world for me
No matter who the people I know
We will always have a good time when we're taking it slow
 
well I...can't get over this
there's even...so much in just one kiss
I just...wish I didn't miss so much
The endless...depths of meaning in your touch
 
Well we were driving with the summer stars overhead
Through the verdant valley, fields of flowers flaming red
We kept on going right across the ocean blue
You should have seen us out there, majestic on the move

Swedish Movie Song (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
The memories that come to me, alone
These dreams I have that make me feel home
It's all in your mind it's all for one
Is't only for the end that we've begun?
 
Four suns burned blithely in the sky
The horses' bones were not yet dry
Pretty woman singing in the hay
And all that just at break of day
 
On horseback we rode day and night
From dawn till dusk, through black and white
Feeling comfort in our joint distress
We'd wryly scoff at second guess
 
The memories that come to me, alone
These dreams I have that make me feel home
It's all in your mind it's all for one
Is't only for the end that we've begun?
 
We left the roaring sea behind
Its thund'ring voice still clocks my mind
"Think!" I said. I said it all again.
The wind whipped trees alive again.
 
The memories that come to me, alone
These dreams I have that make me feel home
It's all in your mind it's all for one
Is't only for the end that we've begun?
 
We tucked ourselves inside a cave
For warmth and depth and birth we craved
Coming here we came to fear ourselves
Together deeper in we delve
 
The memories that come to me, alone
These dreams I have that make me feel home
It's all in your mind it's all for one
Is't only for the end that we've begun?
 
The flame that flicks
Our hearts that heat
Today a drop of this I feel the need

Any Time
Dave Kaplan
I don't remember that first day
In sixth grade
But that's when I met you
 
Since then we've been through games,
Grades, dates, parades,
And the social charade of school
 
But one thing has been real
 
Sleep and dream a life anew for free
I know you'd take a punch for me
Even if I threw it
 
We could just be, you'll agree
Time could stop and flee and I'd be happy
Wouldn't miss a bit
 
But one thing has been real
 
Now I feel like you're a part of me
Couldn't stand to be apart you see
So live it up tip top and rock the house with me
Because in my heart, and in my soul, you're welcome company (any time)
 
I'm alive with you at my side
For a while just drive, we'll take a ride
Carry the world with us
 
Look after leap time before time
Fly the by and bide a smile
Slide with no fuss
 
And this is all surreal
 
I finally opened up I grow
So slow but I showed
I know--you
 
Eloped with my soul to grope
Took my hope to cope through [over?] the smoke I saw
I know you!
 
And I can feel
 
Now I feel like you're a part of me
Couldn't stand to be apart you see
So live it up tip top and rock the house with me
Because in my heart, and in my soul, you're welcome company (any time)
 
Abused no more, amused you true
The past is used, my future's view is you
All the way
 
School, or pool (with a cue) in lieu
The jeweled dew strewn sparkling blue
At break of day
 
Things did heal
You're my first wheel
Let's roll

Lyin'
Dave Kaplan
Lyin' in the field I have been for days
Don't even remember losing my way
Mud soaked to my back through my shirt
Instead of pants I'm wearing dirt
I try to remember when I was standing
But I just feel the pain of my landing
Wanna get up and run around
But I remain on the soiled ground
 
I'm lyin' in the field
I think I can, but I know I can't
I'm lyin' in the field
See if these run-down legs will break under this hollow man
I'm lyin' in the field
Yeah?………okay
 
Such a pretty view from where I lie
But that's a lie it's just the sky
Green stalks shoot up around my head
Wondering if I'm already dead
So I'll just lie here for a while
Too hard to try instead I'll smile
Pretend my home is where I reside
Pretend I found the best place to hide

I'm lyin' in the field
I think I can, but I know I can't
I'm lyin' in the field
See if these run-down legs will break under this hollow man
I'm lyin' in the field
Yeah?………okay
 
Night has come I feel tired
Wasn't such a bad day to be mired
Tomorrow I'll end this stupid blight
Tomorrow…goodnight

Hell (Not Quite) (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
Couple weeks ago, I met a girl
The happiest creature with the brightest smile
Soon became my only care in the world
Turned me back into a naïve child

Started chasing her on legs made out of charm
Bought her flowers, made her a CD
But still she would not melt into my beeswax arms
I think I've seen this one before on the TV

Hell if I care what's happening with you
When I can barely care what's happening with me
At least before I knew what I wanted to do
Now I'm just a black hole for rays of sympathy
I wish you didn't but you did and now I don't
Can't say you're wrong, but you can't possibly be right
You took away all of the life that I was loaned
But there's no way I'm going down without a fight

When I see you I try to kill my joy
Look away, and push back down that boy
But I know I still feel you inside
Something I can't control and so I'm terrified

When I talk to you I feel worlds away
Try to not care, not dwell on what you say
But always after you say goodbye and leave
I wanna cry for hurting you just how I hurt me

Hell if I care what's happening with you
When I can barely care what's happening with me
At least before I knew what I wanted to do
Now I'm just a black hole for rays of sympathy
I wish you didn't but you did and now I don't
Can't say you're wrong, but you can't possibly be right
You took away all of the life that I was loaned
But there's no way I'm going down without a fight

So I scream
So I crawl So I run
So I hate you I love you
And I dream
And I fall and I
Can't seem to grope my way back to...

The Test
Dave Kaplan
So here I sit in this room,
Surrounded by people
And I feel so alone
And by the by my mind wanders
Home
To thinking of you

I remember all the fun
I want to run
To you
All alone
And just sit beside you
In your kitchen
Eating cookies

I wonder 'bout the day
That you ran away
You didn't say anything at all
And I see myself back on that cliff,
Didn't think I would fall (how could I fall?)

I thought that we would be friends
And I thought that the good times would
Go on and on
I guess I was wrong

I can never let go
But I've got nothing to show
Didn't want for this to happen
But you know that I'll do it again
I hate this pattern: it's a broken record
But I'll play it again, and again, and again,
Yes you know I'd do it all over again

Tree Song
Dave Kaplan
When I was young, I planted a tree
In my back yard, from hopeful seeds.
I gave that plant tender loving care
Kept it from harm when exposed and bare

Although it seems like we've come a long way,
I planted her just yesterday
She grew too big and fell to the ground
Her weak roots up and proud head down

Those days and nights watching her grow
I guess the trouble was all down below
She sprouted up but height's not all
It just hurts more when on you she falls

Although it seems like we've come a long way,
I planted her just yesterday
She grew too big and fell to the ground
Her weak roots up and proud head down

I coulda made it easy, picked a flower
That smelled so sweet and looked so fine,
I coulda:
Not gone and screwed things up or tried so hard
To find the One to climb to Heaven and just be mine
I just need more than what I have or what I see
Right here in my hands on my doorstep.
Don't you know I:
Am never satisfied but nothing good has
Come from it, why am I so inept?

So now I sit, right here on this log
I wonder if the storm was from God.
She was too young to die in my hands,
I miss her...she's dead...I love her...

Pumpkin
Dave Kaplan
Come home from school at three
Go online for company
I tell them what I'm gonna do
They say, "That's great man, good for you"

Spent the afternoon just waiting...
I wanted the top so bad I couldn't even start the climb

I dial the phone, but just six numbers
Walk down the aisle and turn around
I try and reach, I'm almost finished
But I just end up losing ground

Now I can barely move
She's too good for me, too cool
I know it's just one night
But might be the best of my life

Spent the afternoon just waiting...
I wanted the top so bad I couldn't even start the climb

I dial the phone, but just six numbers
Walk down the aisle and turn around
I try and reach, I'm almost finished
But I just end up losing ground

I dial the phone, but just six numbers
Walk down the aisle and turn around
I try and reach, I'm almost finished
But I just end up losing ground

I dial the phone, now seven numbers
I say hello and she says hi
We talk and laugh, and then I ask her
I really knew that everything would be fine

Set Sail
Dave Kaplan
I start to walk away,
I think in complete stealth,
My leg still limps a little,
And still no source of wealth
Some kind passers-by
ask me if I'm alright
I flash them a quick smile,
Pretend my goal's in sight

But all I really try to do is...

Sail away, across the streets, try not to hit the people
Because any day, my fate I'll meet, but I can't help but hit the people

I finally turn the corner
Can't see home no more
Realize I left my toothbrush
But now I'm on the opposite shore
The sun is overhead
The warmth burns the back of my neck
I bet the vultures circling
See me as just a tiny little speck

But all I really want to do is...

Sail away, across the streets, try not to hit the people
Because any day, my fate I'll meet, but I can't help but hit the people

This is it, I've reached the end of the line
But for what it's worth, the air in my lungs is all mine, it's all mine...yeah!

But all I really need to do is...

Sail away, across the streets, try not to hit the people
Because any day, my fate I'll meet, but I can't help but hit the people

Sail away, across the streets, try not to hit the people
Because any day, my fate I'll meet, but I can't help but hit the people

Drifter
Dave Kaplan
A man walked outside, it began to rain
He cursed the clouds that damped his shirt
As he was bathed in clear cold water
He felt alone, his arthritis hurt
As he stared at his plodding feet below
Above a rainbow started to form
The colors arched from the laundromat to infinity
John shivered, trying to stay warm

He reached his home and opened the door,
On the floor and the wall he saw lines of ants
Raid was sprayed, the lines went dead
To fill their place: a string of rants.
The ant source was a crack in the grout
On the counter near the dripping sink
Their path grew out like flowing veins
Towards graham cracker bits and cranberry drink

Oh what's the use in getting so mad
You always act like you've been had
Why can't you sit and calm down
You'll scare the kids with that tense frown
Just look up and try to see the moonlight
As you drift deeper into the night

The bed was soft, his blankets warm
And sleep was on the verge of John
His son came in and tugged on him
And offered his 7-year-old expert opinion:
There were monsters under his bed
But all Dad wanted was noiseless rest
They were round and furry and red
But Dad just thought he was a pest

Oh what's the use in getting so mad
You always act like you've been had
Why can't you sit and calm down
You'll scare the kids with that tense frown
Just look up and try to see the moonlight
As you drift deeper into the night

Well I know this isn't why you came around
You know you're missing oh so much more
Don't you want to drown in the beautiful sound
With the little blond boy whom you so adore

Oh what's the use in getting so mad
You always act like you've been had
Why can't you sit and calm down
You'll scare the kids with that tense frown
Just look up and try to see the moonlight
As you drift deeper into the night

Kids These Days (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
you are so small and yet so full of life
i don't understand why it always fades
kids start so pure and bright
but they fade with class and grades

i look around, see schools full of stars
wrestling and giggling, having no care
i see the light in every freckle,
in every dimple and strand of your chestnut hair

but then i look around a little bit further
i look to those not far down the road
they insult and torment and waste away
the worst turn their backs and lock and load

but seeing you now brings so much hope
your skin's still soft and smooth and aglow
there's enough love in you to fill a lonely mansion
enough to raise up the lowest of the low
i just want to hug out some warmth
to keep off cold Time for a while
you may be as small as a puddle
but what's inside could swell the Nile

******
Remains
Dave Kaplan
i heard of a man
who couldn't quite fit
beside
the rest of his dreams

he always wore blue
his shirt always fit
just so
nobody could see

that he had no hand
to hold in his own
no more
since she had left

all that he remembers of her
is how warm she felt
when he hugged her
when he was feeling down

nothing she remembers of him
will betray that love
that she swore she
would someday tell him

all that is
left

now time never tells
the story too well
to me:
the greatest adventure

the here and the now
keep talking too loud
for me
to hear the right answer

but life ain't a test
but i can't afford
to miss
no more than you

all that he remembers of her
are those big brown eyes
when the tears came
when she was feeling down

nothing she remembers in him
can reflect the smile
that he saw in
her brown eyes every day

all that is
left

all that he remembers of her
is the way she loved
to laugh at him
for stupid little things

nothing she remembers of him
can compare to him
can compare to
the sleep she never gets

all that he remembers of her is everything
he wants
to be

all that he remembers of her
is nothing
left

January 19
Dave Kaplan
you should go away, we should all go away for a while
i could use a place for myself
too much on my mind, too little on my shoulders
glad i've got friends here to help

when i can't fall asleep at night
everything is still alright, you by my side
when there's no end in sight
you be my light
i'm alright

i've been thinking 'bout how to get out; now i'm almost back in
it brings a smile to my face
still i wonder now, maybe second doubt, if i won't fall again
or maybe this is my place to stay
and it's a beautiful day

when i can't fall asleep at night
everything is still alright, you by my side
when there's no end in sight
you be my light
i'm alright

******
Just Me
Dave Kaplan
i've been having these dreams at night
she keeps pushing to pull me back in
i always wonder if it's right this time
but then i wake up all over again

i waited on the steps outside
it was cold but i was hopeful
for another to read my mind
for another to share my soul

well if we had more time
would it make it easier
for me to find you
when it's on the line
can i just be me

i walk up a hill every day
to see my friends so we can play
i slide down hill every night
to brush my teeth and turn out the lights

i wonder why in that time alone
i never think of reasons or answers why (on downbeat)
everybody feels safe at home
why everybody needs more time

well if we had more time
would it make it easier
for me to find you
when it's on the line
can i just be me

Gauguin
Dave Kaplan
paul was a business man
   livin' in the city
   got himself a pretty
woman to be his wife

everything according to plan
   his misses had some babies
   he'd always told her "maybe
someday i'll buy you a new life"

one day paul ran away
to the coast of brittany
to paint the simple way
breath of faith by the sea

all he ever wanted
put down on canvas
everything inside him
show the beauty of
simplicity primality
and tear a page
from the book
of eternal beauty

things were alright for a time
   painted local women
   vision from the sermon's
story on the red red grass

he needed more than just rhyme
   tropical hot weather
   and somewhere altogether
unscathed of european class

one day paul ran away
to the island of tahiti
to paint the native way
export his myth to pear E

all he ever wanted
put down on canvas
everything inside him
show the beauty of
simplicity primality
and tear a page
from the book
of eternal beauty

monsieur serusier
came for advice one day
and gaugin had this to say:

do you see green?
is it really truly green?
the use the most beautiful paint
brush it strong just like you mean

all he ever wanted
put down on canvas
everything inside him
show the beauty of
simplicity primality
and tear a page
from the book
of eternal beauty

North Carolina Junction (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
as i moved on by
she asked what i was doing
told her i was
just running

after i was done
i asked what she was doing
told me she just
played tennis

talked about our year
another one in college
told each other
the same thing

talked about our lives
and where they both were heading
all told we knew
just nothing

she told me her conclusion:
that she was confused
that she needed to
play more tennis

stood out in the sun
our discourse lightly losing
all sense of cold
or proving

said she wanted some
direction she could stand on
avenue to
go marching

all advice had laughed
said she should like exploring
they had never
liked driving

amid all this confusion
her eyes had shut down
her conclusion was
i just don't know

as i turned to go
i asked why she was still there
said she only
ran alone

It's The Girl (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
it was the first time in a long time
for me to hear your teasing voice
it was the first time in a while for me
to feel those bittersweet pangs of joy
didn't seem like it had been so long
because i saw you every day
driving down inside my thoughts
making me smile all the way

today again i checked my phone
in the parking lot before going home
i hoped to God that it was her
but i knew
she was gone
and besides
she won't call

but when i heard her voice say hey
it did more than make my day
my little wish had really come true
but i know
she still gone
still for me
i felt like

it was the first time in a long time
for me to hear your teasing voice
it was the first time in a while for me
to feel those bittersweet pangs of joy
didn't seem like it had been so long
because i saw you every day
driving down inside my thoughts
making me smile all the way

i started thinking that i was wrong
when the conversation didn't last long
was it the girl or just the dream
'cause i'd like
to be sure
that i know
what i need

as i sat with that phone in my hands
man i miss her so bad
couldn't hear the sky fall
let's go over again how you want this to end
if it's her
or it's me
my one hope
is always
feel like that first i was with you
or the starry night we shared in my pool
i love to dance with you fast or slow
even too fast sometimes is the way to go
the first was too
	soon but the
	second too late
the way i surprised
	you on our first date
give me your hand babe
	and squeeze real
	tight
we'll melt into each
	other every night
Lord it feels so right
Lord I hope I get by
	until...

Sculpture of the Grand (unrecorded)
Dave Kaplan
he said
go on boy
find something that you can believe in
make it your life
be obsessed and just throw yourself
into
whatever you choose
that's how to have a life


one man
locked up in his own home
pages strewn across the
room he likes to
put his thoughts down

they say
he's a little crazy
missing out on nights in
town he'd rather
dream away


one mom
pays for all the lessons
knowing well her daughter's
felt what she thinks
is her meaning

this girl
singing her whole heart out
hoping she can someday
be a star for all
the world


as for me
i don't think
i'm old enough
to be so sure
i'm dreaming of 
the only thing for
me
but when i am
you can be sure
i'll do it all
for me and her

Smooth Lines (poetry)
Dave Kaplan
When the trees
of the Northeast pass
by as endless outlines
of the world--
 
It darkens,
leaving only lights
across the water's
placid surface.
But reflected in the
 
window is,
as I focus:
 
A man, standing,
with glasses
and a well-kempt beard
of bark-brown,
in a collared shirt

--gently rocking in his arms
a white blanketed horizon with
the most beautiful sunrise
I have ever seen.

The Farm
Dave Kaplan
still it's that place on the country farm
on the back porch swing and the city gone
dive into those yellow waves
wheat fields in the heat all day
stayin outside all through the night
in the clean air underneath the natural light
yellow stars consume the sky
warming swirls into my eyes
help me feel i know the answer why

been losing my mind
since losing my old life
i keep trying
to find a new way
i moved away from my town
turned myself all around
got my own house
to keep shadows at bay

still it's that place on the country farm
on the back porch swing and the city gone
dive into those yellow waves
wheat fields in the heat all day
stayin outside all through the night
in the clean air underneath the natural light
yellow stars consume the sky
warming swirls into my eyes
help me feel i know the answer why

i can't be alone
just colors and a radio
but i'm not known
for breaking shells
no more ideas
gone through all four seasons
lost all the women
but i can't tell

******
There Was A Girl
Dave Kaplan
there was a girl
should have loved her better
than i did
there was another girl
should've known her better
than i did

the one i knew well
i could see all the problems
that we'd have down the line
with the other, well
i couldn't see anything at all
so i thought we'd be fine

it's not hard to realize
once you climb that fence
that it was the first side
where you belong
but they won't let you back
no you won't even let yourself in
but i have no regrets

this is a world
where it's always better
than i know
there is another world
where it's never better
than i know

on the one hand
we could do this barefoot
but i don't have too much time
give me a hand
with this red wheelbarrow
oh so much depends on my mind

it's not hard to realize
once you climb that fence
that it was the first side
where you belong
but they won't let you back
no you won't even let yourself in
but i have no regrets

To (poetry)
Dave Kaplan
The answers that I find are meant for some
one other than myself.  The questions differ.

I am trying very hard to capture
trapped gazelle.  They need to run, to catch them.

I learned to milk a goat, to ride a horse,
to tame a deer, to hunt and roast wild boar.

Nothing helps.  I need to follow more than
listen--free gazelle and follow them too

Wedding Cakes and Tall Buildings
Dave Kaplan
a wedding cake decorator
	from colorado
came to see the big
	national contest
with towers layered up with
	icing columns and flowers
he was hit with awe of
	seeing the best
and he said

i couldn't tell you
what it all means
i can barely describe
(to you) how it feels
but this is my grand inspiration
yeah this is my inspiration

young woman with aspirations
	to be a doctor
saw her friend rescued by
	the emt's
her memory is a blur of blood
	and shouts of direction
but clear as day she knew just what
	she wanted to be

i couldn't tell you
what it all means
i can barely describe
(to you) how it feels
but this is my grand inspiration
yeah this is my inspiration

a boy about eighteen years old
	just out of high school
sits enraptured staring at the
	silver screen
a story is unfolding about
	false hopes and true love
he thinks it's the most beautiful
	thing he's ever seen

i couldn't tell you
what it all means
i can barely describe
(to you) how it feels
but this is my grand inspiration
yeah this is my inspiration

Where We Don't Go
Dave Kaplan
so it's just another lazy sunday afternoon
waiting for the rain to come down
waiting to have it wash away everything to do
waiting for next time, now

and then it comes down hard and then it goes away
the river flows faster slightly
i run with the river, and then i'm tired again
and how can i put this politely?

it's what i'm sinking into
that's keeping me above
it's what's distracting me
from what i'm thinking of
the reason i kissed you
the reason i miss you
Don't, doubt for a day:
you're my ice cream sundae

now it's just a hopeless lazy sunday evening
watching the game, on a couch
watching my reflection watching me in the TV
watching my hapless slouch

far away, in another world it seems
she's helping people to realize their dreams
and she's got her own, and i'm saving mine away
guess she's got better things to be doing today

it's what i'm sinking into
that's keeping me above
it's what's distracting me
from what i'm thinking of
the reason i kissed you
the reason i miss you
Don't, doubt for a day:
you're my ice cream sundae

Charter (unrecorded/unfinished)
Dave Kaplan
My name is Dave
my favorite place on the Street
is Charter
no other club is harder to beat.
I live upstairs, paid my dues,
worked my share for you
the members, remember it's true--
we can't lose
maybe forfeit
a sports gig (or two).
But my people are proud
of our beautiful house.
Even the third floor mouse
hates the crowd down the block.
He escaped to our place,
came for cake
and the bak-
lava Chef Tom makes.
--
I know there's bad apples,
just ask the portal window
and the flag they stole
under our nose
or the extinguisher shot
in the kitchen, that mess
or the glass
broken out,
a drunken shout,
they're flaunting disrespect
not knowing they're next
to be gone,
bye bye, don't cry,
but when I say goodnight
inside
I can't breathe--
don't want out
coming in
lock the door and the sin,
back up, more
thinkin'
I'll lose if I just try to win
other people a chance to be free
from their knees.
Stand up, walk tall,
feel the breeze,
hands out--but I talk
big, act small,
it's appalling to me.
Why can't it be easy?
Why am I so bothered?
Not my problem,
right--how can I solve it?

Poesia (poetry; first half--2nd is Spanish)
Dave Kaplan
I look up:
the white snow extends out
upwards unwrinkled past the edge
of my sight
and the white lamp spheres extend out
downward convergent lining up
unlit
but for the brilliant white sun
bouncing off the shimmering snow
the glassy lamp lights
my sparkling eyes
that now see you.
