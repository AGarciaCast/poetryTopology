The Steeple-Jack (1935)
Marianne Moore
Dürer would have seen a reason for living
	in towns like this, with eight stranded whales
to look at; with the sweet sea air coming into your house
on a fine day, from water etched
	with waves as formal as the scales
on a fish.
One by one in two’s and three’s, the seagulls keep
	flying back and forth over the town clock,
or sailing around the lighthouse without moving their wings–
rising steadily with a slight
	quiver of the body–or flock
mewing where
a sea the purple of the peacock’s neck is
	paled to greenish azure as Dürer changed
the pine green of the Tyrol to peacock blue and guinea
gray. You can see a twenty-five-
pound lobster; and fish nets arranged
to dry. The
whirlwind fife-and-drum of the storm bends the salt
	marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the
star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so
much confusion. Disguised by what 
	might seem the opposite, the sea-
side flowers and
trees are favored by the fog so that you have
	the tropics at first hand: the trumpet-vine,
fox-glove, giant snap-dragon, a salpiglossis that has
spots and stripes; morning-glories, gourds,
	or moon-vines trained on fishing-twine
at the back door;
cat-tails, flags, blueberries and spiderwort,
	striped grass, lichens, sunflowers, asters, daisies–
yellow and crab-claw ragged sailors with green bracts–toad plant,
petunias, ferns; pink lilies, blue
	ones, tigers; poppies; black sweet-peas.
The climate
is not right for the banyan, frangipani, or
	jack-fruit trees; or for exotic serpent
life. Ring lizard and snake-skin for the foot, if you see fit;
but here they’ve cats, not cobras, to
	keep down the rats. The different
little newt
with white pin-dots on black horizontal spaced-
	out bands lives here; yet there is nothing that
ambition can buy or take away. The college student 
named Ambrose sits on the hillside
	with his not-native books and hat
and sees boats
at sea progress white and rigid as if in
	a groove. Liking an elegance of which 
the source is not bravado, he knows by heart the antique 
sugar-bowl shaped summer-house of 
	interlacing slats, and the pitch
of the church
spire, not true, from which a man in scarlet lets
	down a rope as a spider spins a thread;
he might be part of a novel, but on the sidewalk a 
sign says C. J. Poole, Steeple-Jack,
	in black and white; and one in red
and white says
Danger. The church portico has four fluted 
	columns, each a single piece of stone, made
modester by white-wash. This would be a fit haven for 
waifs, children, animals, prisoners,
	and presidents who have repaid 
sin-driven
senators by not thinking about them. The
	place has a school-house, a post-office in a 
store, fish-houses, hen-houses, a three-masted
	schooner on
the stocks. The hero, the student,
	the steeple-jack, each in his way,
is at home.
It could not be dangerous to be living 
in a town like this, of simple people,
who have a steeple-jack placing signs by the church
while he is gilding the solid-
	pointed star, which on a steeple
stands for hope.

No Swan So Fine (1935)
Marianne Moore
"No water so still as the
	dead fountains of Versailles." No swan,
with swart blind look askance 
and gondoliering legs, so fine
	as chintz china one with fawn-
brown eyes and toothed gold
collar on to show whose bird it was.

Lodged in the Louis Fifteenth
	candelabrum-tree of cockscomb-
tinted buttons, dahlias,
sea-urchins, and everlastings,
	it perches on the branching foam
of polished sculptured 
flowers–at ease and tall. The king is dead

The Fish (1935)
Marianne Moore
wade
through black jade
	Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
	adjusting the ash heaps;
	 opening and shutting itself like 
an
injured fan.
	The barnacles which encrust the side
	of the wave, cannot hide
	 there for the submerged shafts of the
sun,
split like spun
	glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness
	into the crevices–
	 in and out, illuminating
the 
turquoise sea
	of bodies. The water drives a wedge
	of iron through the iron edge
	 of the cliff; whereupon the stars,
pink
rice-grains, ink-
	bespattered jelly-fish, crabs like green
	lilies, and submarine
	 toadstools, slide each on the other.
All
external
	marks of abuse are present on this
	defiant edifice–
	 all the physical features of
ac-
cident–lack
	of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and
	hatchet strokes, these things stand 
	 out on it; the chasm-side is
dead.
Repeated 
	evidence has proved that it can live
	on what can not revive
	 its youth. The sea grows old in it.

Poetry (1935)
Marianne Moore
I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
	Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in
	it after all, a place for the genuine.
		Hands that can grasp, eyes
		that can dilate, hair that can rise
			if it must, these things are important not because a 
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
	useful. When they become so derivative as to be unintelligible,
	the same thing may be said for all of us, that we
		do not admire what
		we cannot understand: the bat
			holding on upside down or in quest of something to
eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
	a tree, the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse that feels    a 
		flea, the base-
	ball fan, the statistician–
	nor is it valid 
		to discriminate against ‘business documents and
school-books’; all these phenomena are important. One must make a dis-
tinction 
however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not
	poetry,
nor till the poets among us can be
	‘literalists of
	the imagination’–above 
		insolence and triviality and can present
for inspection, ‘imaginary gardens with real toads in them’, shall    we have
	it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand,
	the raw material of poetry in
		all its rawness and 
		that which is on the other hand 
		genuine, you are interested in poetry.

A Grave (1935)
Marianne Moore
Man looking into the sea,
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as
					                	                      you have yourself,
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing,
but you cannot stand in the middle of this;
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in procession, each with an emerald turkey-
						 			    foot at the top,
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious character of
										       the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look–
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer
									   investigate them
for their bones have not lasted:
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are
								       desecrating a grave,
and row quickly away–the blades of the oars
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were
					 			  no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx–
 				 	       beautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the
							 			        seaweed;
the bird swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls
						 				  as heretofore–
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion
						 				    beneath them;
and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of
							 			         bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which
				 		     dropped things are bound to sink–
in which they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor
						 			            consciousness.

An Octopus (1935)
Marianne Moore
of ice. Deceptively reserved and flat,
it lies "in grandeur and in mass"
beneath a sea of shifting snow-dunes;
dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly defined
											pseudo-podia
made of glass that will bend–a much needed invention–
comprising twenty-eight ice-fields from fifty to five hundred
											feet thick,
of unimagined delicacy.
"Picking periwinkles from the cracks"
or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python,
it hovers forward "spider fashion
on its arms" misleading like lace;
its "ghostly pallor changing
to the green metallic tinge of an anemone-starred pool."
The fir-trees, in "the magnitude of their root systems,"
rise aloof from these maneuvers "creepy to behold,"
austere specimens of our American royal families,
"each like the shadow of the one beside it.
The rock seems frail compared with the dark energy of life,"
its vermilion and onyx and manganese-blue interior expensiveness
left at the mercy of the weather;
"stained transversely by iron where the water drips down,"
recognized by its plants and its animals.
Completing a circle,
you have been deceived into thinking that you have progressed,
under the polite needles of the larches
"hung to filter, not to intercept the sunlight"–
met by tightly wattled spruce-twigs
"conformed to an edge like clipped cypress
as if no branch could penetrate the cold beyond its company";
and dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing The Goat’s Mirror–
that lady-fingerlike depression in the shape of the left human
											         foot,
which prejudices you in favor of itself
before you have had time to see the others;
its indigo, pea-green, blue-green, and turquoise,
from a hundred to two hundred feet deep,
"merging in irregular patches in the middle of the lake
where, like gusts of a storm
obliterating the shadows of the fir-trees, the wind makes lanes
										          of ripples."
What spot could have merits of equal importance
for bears, elks, deer, wolves, goats, and ducks?
Pre-empted by their ancestors,
this is the property of the exacting porcupine,
and of the rat "slipping along to its burrow in the swamp
or pausing on high ground to smell the heather";
of "thoughtful beavers
making drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels,"
and of the bears inspecting unexpectedly
ant-hills and berry-bushes.
Composed of calcium gems and alabaster pillars,
topaz, tourmaline crystals and amethyst quartz,
their den in somewhere else, concealed in the confusion
of "blue forests thrown together with marble and jasper and agate
as if the whole quarries had been dynamited."
And farther up, in a stag-at-bay position
as a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites,
stands the goat,
its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall–
an endless skein swayed by the wind,
immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks.
A special antelope
acclimated to "grottoes from which issue penetrating draughts
which make you wonder why you came,"
it stands it ground
on cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vapor–
black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields,
the ermine body on the crystal peak;
the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene,
										  dyeing them white–
upon this antique pedestal,
"a mountain with those graceful lines which prove it a volcano,"
its top a complete cone like Fujiyama’s
till an explosion blew it off.
Distinguished by a beauty
of which "the visitor dare never fully speak at home
for fear of being stoned as an impostor,"
Big Snow Mountain is the home of a diversity of creatures:
those who "have lived in hotels
but who now live in camps–who prefer to";
the mountain guide evolving from the trapper,
"in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older,
wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees";
"the nine-striped chipmunk
running with unmammal-like agility along a log";
the water ouzel
with "its passion for rapids and high-pressured falls,"
building under the arch of some tiny Niagara;
the white-tailed ptarmigan "in winter solid white,
feeding on heather-bells and alpine buckwheat";
and the eleven eagles of the west,
"fond of the spring fragrance and the winter colors,"
used to the unegoistic action of the glaciers
and "several hours of frost every midsummer night."
"They make a nice appearance, don’t they,"
happy see nothing?
Perched on treacherous lava and pumice–
those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleavers
which stipulate "names and addresses of persons to notify
in case of disaster"–
they hear the roar of ice and supervise the water
winding slowly through the cliffs,
the road "climbing like the thread
which forms the groove around a snail-shell,
doubling back and forth until where snow begins, it ends."
No "deliberate wide-eyed wistfulness" is here
among the boulders sunk in ripples and white water
where "when you hear the best wild music of the forest
it is sure to be a marmot,"
the victim on some slight observatory,
of "a struggle between curiosity and caution,"
inquiring what has scared it:
a stone from the moraine descending in leaps,
another marmot, or the spotted ponies with glass eyes,
brought up on frosty grass and flowers
and rapid draughts of ice-water.
Instructed none knows how, to climb the mountain,
by business men who require for recreation
three hundred and sixty-five holidays in the year,
these conspicuously spotted little horses are peculiar;
hard to discern among the birch-trees, ferns, and lily-pads,
avalanche lilies, Indian paint-brushes,
bear’s ears and kittentails,
and miniature cavalcades of chlorophylless fungi
magnified in profile on the moss-beds like moonstones in the water;
the cavalcade of calico competing 
with the original American menagerie of styles
among the white flowers of the rhododendron surmounting
										       rigid leaves
upon which moisture works its alchemy,
transmuting verdure into onyx.

"Like happy souls in Hell," enjoying mental difficulties,
										      the Greeks
amused themselves with delicate behavior
because it was "so noble and fair";
not practised in adapting their intelligence
to eagle-traps and snow-shoes,
to alpenstocks and other toys contrived by those
"alive to the advantage of invigorating pleasures."
Bows, arrows, oars, and paddles, for which trees provide the
											         wood,
in new countries more eloquent than elsewhere–
augmenting the assertion that, essentially humane,
"the forest affords wood for dwellings and by its beauty
stimulates the moral vigor of its citizens."
The Greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was back
of what could not be clearly seen,
resolving with benevolent conclusiveness,
"complexities which still will be complexities
as long as the world lasts";
ascribing what we clumsily call happiness,
to "an accident or a quality,
a spiritual substance or the soul itself,
an act, a disposition, or a habit,
or a habit infused, to which the soul has been persuaded,
or something distinct from a habit, a power"–
such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of.
"Emotionally sensitive, their hearts were hard";
their wisdom was remote
from that of these odd oracles of cool official sarcasm,
upon this game preserve
where "guns, nets, seines, traps, and explosives,
hired vehicles, gambling and intoxicants are prohibited;
disobedient persons being summarily removed
and not allowed to return without permission in writing."
It is self-evident 
that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one;
that one must do as one is told
and eat rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoes
this fossil flower concise without a shiver,
intact when it is cut,
damned for its sacrosanct remoteness–
like Henry James "damned by the public for decorum";
not decorum, but restraint;
it is the love of doing hard things
that rebuffed and wore them out–a public out of sympathy
											 with neatness.

Neatness of finish! Neatness of finish!
Relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopus
with its capacity for fact.
"Creeping slowly as with meditated stealth,
its arms seeming to approach from all directions,"
it receives one under winds that "tear the snow to bits
and hurl it like a sandblast
shearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees."
Is "tree" the word for these things
"flat on the ground like vines"?
some "bent in a half circle with branches on one side
suggesting dust-brushes, not trees;
some finding strength in union, forming little stunted grooves
their flattened mats of branches shrunk in trying to escape"
from the hard mountain "planned by ice and polished by the
											     wind"–
the white volcano with no weather side;
the lightning flashing at its base,
rain falling in the valleys, and snow falling on the peak–
the glassy octopus symmetrically pointed,
its claw cut by the avalanche
"with a sound like the crack of a rifle,
in a curtain of powdered snow launched like a waterfall."

Marriage (1935)
Marianne Moore
This institution,
perhaps one should say enterprise
out of respect for which
one says one need not change one’s mind
about a thing one has believed in,
requiring public promises
of one’s intention
to fulfill a private obligation:
I wonder what Adam and Eve
think of it by this time,
this fire-gilt steel
alive with goldenness;
how bright it shows–
"of circular traditions and impostures,
committing many spoils,"
requiring all one’s criminal ingenuity
to avoid!
Psychology which explains everything
explains nothing,
and we are still in doubt.
Eve: beautiful woman–
I have seen her
when she was so handsome
she gave me a start,
able to write simultaneously
in three languages–
English, German and French–
and talk in the meantime;
equally positive in demanding a commotion
and in stipulating quiet:
"I should like to be alone";
to which the visitor replies,
"I should like to be alone;
why not be alone together?"
Below the incandescent stars
below the incandescent fruit,
the strange experience of beauty;
its existence is too much;
it tears one to pieces
and each fresh wave of consciousness
is poison.
"See her, see her in this common world,"
the central flaw
in that first crystal-fine experiment,
this amalgamation which can never be more
than an interesting impossibility,
describing it
as "that strange paradise
unlike flesh, stones,
gold or stately buildings,
the choicest piece of my life:
the heart rising
in its estate of peace
as a boat rises
with the rising of the water";
constrained in speaking of the serpent–
shed snakeskin in the history of politeness
not to be returned to again–
that invaluable accident
exonerating Adam.
And he has beauty also;
it’s distressing–Adam;
"something feline,
something colubrine"–how true!
a crouching mythological monster
in that Persian miniature of emerald mines,
raw silk–ivory white, snow white,
oyster white and six others–
that paddock full of leopards and giraffe–
long lemon-yellow bodies
sown with trapezoids of blue.
Alive with words,
vibrating like a cymbal
touched before it has been struck,
he has prophesied correctly–
the industrious waterfall,
"the speedy stream
which violently bears all before it,
at one time silent as the air
and now as powerful as the wind."
"Treading chasms
on the uncertain footing of a spear,"
forgetting that there is in woman
a quality of mind
which as an instinctive manifestation
is unsafe,
he goes on speaking
in a formal customary strain,
of "past states, the present state,
seals, promises,
the evil one suffered,
the good one enjoys,
hail, heaven,
everything convenient 
to promote one’s joy."
In him a state of mind
perceives what it was not
intended that he should;
"he experiences a solemn joy
in seeing that he has become an idol."
Plagued by the nightingale
in the new leaves,
with its silence but its silences,
he says of it:
"It clothes me with a shirt of fire."
"He dares not clap his hands
to make it go on
lest it should fly off;
if he does nothing, it will not understand."
Unnerved by the nightingale
and dazzled by the apple,
impelled by "the illusion of a fire
effectual to extinguish fire,"
compared with which
the shining of the earth
is but deformity–a fire
"as high as deep
as bright as broad
as long as life itself,"
he stumbles over marriage,
"a very trivial object indeed"
to have destroyed the attitude
in which he stood–
the ease of the philosopher 
unfathomed by a woman.
Unhelpful Hymen!
a kind of overgrown cupid
reduced to insignificance
by the mechanical advertising
parading as involuntary comment,
by that experiment of Adam’s
with ways out but no way in–
the ritual of marriage,
augmenting all its lavishness;
its fiddle-head ferns,
lotus flowers, opuntias, white dromedaries,
its hippopotamus–
nose and mouth combined
in one magnificent hopper–
its snake and the potent apple.
He tells us
that "for love that will
gaze an eagle blind,
that is with Hercules
climbing the trees
in the garden of the Hesperides,
from forty-five to seventy
is the best age,"
commending it
as a fine art, as an experiment,
a duty or as merely recreation.
One must not call him ruffian
nor friction a calamity–
the fight to be affectionate:
"no truth can be fully known
until it has been tried
by the tooth of disputation."
The blue panther with black eyes,
the basalt panther with blue eyes,
entirely graceful–
one must give them the path–
the black obsidian Diana
who "darkeneth her countenance
as a bear doth,"
the spiked hand
that has an affectionate for one
and proves it to the bone,
impatient to assure you
that impatience is the mark of independence,
not of bondage.
"Married people often look that way"–
"seldom and cold, up and down,
mixed and malarial
with a good day and a bad."
We Occidentals are so unemotional,
self lost, the irony preserved
in the "Ahasuerus tete-a-tete banquet"
with its small orchids like snakes’ tongues,
with its "good monster, lead the way,"
with little laughter
and munificence of humor
in that quixotic atmosphere of frankness
in which experience attests 
that men have power
and sometimes one is made to feel it.
He says, "What monarch would not blush
to have a wife
with hair like a shaving-brush?"
The fact of woman
is "not the sound of the flute
but very poison."
She says, "Men are monopolists
of ‘stars, garters, buttons, 
and other shining baubles’–
unfit to be the guardians
of another person’s happiness."
He says, "These mummies
must be handled carefully–
‘the crumbs from a lion’s meal,
a couple of shins and the bit of an ear’;
turn to the letter M
and you will find
that ‘a wife is a coffin,’
that severe object
with the pleasing geometry
stipulating space not people,
refusing to be buried
and uniquely disappointing,
revengefully wrought in the attitude 
of an adoring child
to a distinguished parent."
She says, "This butterfly,
this waterfly, this nomad
that has ‘proposed
to settle on my hand for life’–
What can one do with it?
There must have been more time
in Shakespeare’s day
to sit and watch a play.
You know so many artists who are fools."
He says, "You know so many fools
who are not artists."
The fact forgot
that "some have merely rights
while some have obligations,"
he loves himself so much,
he can permit himself
no rival in that love.
She loves herself so much,
he can permit himself
no rival in that love.
She loves herself so much,
she cannot see herself enough–
a statuette of ivory on ivory,
the logical last touch
to an expansive splendor
earned as wages for work done:
one is not rich but poor
when one can always seem so right.
What can one do for them–
these savages
condemned to disaffect
all those who are not visionaries
alert to undertake the silly task
of making people noble?
This model of petrine fidelity
who "leaves her peaceful husband
only because she has seen enough of him"–
that orator reminding you,
"I am yours to command."
"Everything to do with love is mystery;
it is more than a day’s work
to investigate this science."
One sees that it is rare–
that striking grasp of opposites
opposed each to the other, not to unity,
which in cycloid inclusiveness
has dwarfed the demonstration
of Columbus with the egg–
a triumph of simplicity–
that charitive Euroclydon
of frightening disinterestedness
which the world hates,
admitting:
"I am such a cow,
if I had a sorrow
I should feel it a long time;
I am not one of those 
who have a great sorrow
in the morning 
and a great joy at noon’;
which says: "I have encountered it
among those unpretentious 
proteges of wisdom,
where seeming to parade
as the debater and the Roman,
the statesmanship
of an archaic Daniel Webster
persists to their simplicity of temper
as the essence of the matter:
‘Liberty and union
now and forever’;
the Book on the writing-table;
the hand in the breast-pocket."

The Pangolin (1941)
Marianne Moore
Another armored animal–scale
 lapping scale with spruce-cone regularity until they
form the uninterrupted central 
 tail row! This near artichoke with head and legs and
 grit-equipped gizzard,
the night miniature artist engineer is,
 yes, Leonardo da Vinci’s replica–
 impressive animal and toiler of whom we seldom hear.
 Armor seems extra. But for him,
 the closing ear-ridge–
 or bare ear licking even this small
 eminence and similarly safe
contracting nose and eye apertures
 impenetrably closable, are not;–a true ant-eater,
not cockroach-eater, who endures
 exhausting solitary trips through unfamiliar ground at night,
 returning before sunrise; stepping in the moonlight,
 on the moonlight peculiarly, that the outside
 edges of his hands may bear the weight and save the
 claws
 for digging. Serpentined about
 the tree, he draws
 away from danger unpugnaciously,
 with no sound but a harmless hiss; keeping
the fragile grace of the Thomas-
 of-Leighton Buzzard Westminster Abbey wrought-iron
 vine, or
rolls himself into a ball that has
 power to defy all effort to unroll it; strongly intailed, neat
 head for core, on neck not breaking off, with curled-in feet.
 Nevertheless he has sting-proof scales; and nest
 of rocks closed with earth from inside, which he can 
 thus darken.
Sun and moon and day and night and man and beast
 each with a splendor 
 which man in all his vileness cannot
 set aside; each with an excellence!
"Fearful yet to be feared," the armored
 ant-eater met by the driver-ant does not turn back, but
engulfs what he can, the flattered sword-
 edged leafpoints on the tail and artichoke set leg-and 
 body-plates
quivering violently when it retaliates 
 and swarms on him. Compact like the furled fringed frill
 on the hat-brim of Gargallo’s hollow iron head of a 
 matador, he will drop and will
 then walk away
 unhurt, although if unintruded on,
 he cautiously works down the tree, helped
by his tail. The giant-pangolin-
 tail, graceful tool, as prop or hand or broom or ax, tipped like 
an elephant’s trunk with special skin,
 is not lost on this ant-and stone-swallowing uninjurable
 artichoke which simpletons thought a living fable
 whom the stones had nourished, whereas ants had done
 so. Pangolins are not aggressive animals; between
 dusk and day they have the not unchain-like machine-like
 form and frictionless creep of a thing
 made graceful by adversities, con-
versities. To explain grace requires 
 a curious hand. If that which is at all were not forever,
why would those who graced the spires
 with animals and gathered there to rest, on cold luxurious
 low stone seats–a monk and monk and monk–between the
 thus
 ingenious roof-supports, have slaved to confuse
 grace with a kindly manner, time in which to pay a 
 debt,
 the cure for sins, a graceful use
 of what are yet
 approved stone mullions branching out across
 the perpendiculars? A sailboat
was the first machine. Pangolins, made
 for moving quietly also, are models of exactness,
on four legs; on hind feet plantigrade,
 with certain postures of a man. Beneath sun and moon,
 man slaving
 to make his life more sweet, leaves half the flowers worth
 having,
 needing to choose wisely how to use his strength;
 a paper-maker like the wasp; a tractor of foodstuffs,
 like the ant; spidering a length
 of web from bluffs
 above a stream; in fighting, mechanicked
 like to pangolin; capsizing in
disheartenment. Bedizened or stark
 naked, man, the self, the being we call human, writing-
master to this world, griffons a dark 
 "Like does not like like that is obnoxious"; and writes error
 with four
 r’s. Among animals, one has a sense of humor.
 Humor saves a few steps, it saves years. Uningnorant,
 modest and unemotional, and all emotion,
 he has everlasting vigor,
 power to grow,
 though there are few creatures who can make one
 breathe faster and make one erecter.
Not afraid of anything is he,
 and then goes cowering forth, tread paced to meet an obstacle
at every step. Consistent with the 
 formula–warm blood, no gills, two pairs of hands and a few 
 hairs–that
 is a mammal; there he sits in his own habitat,
 serge-clad, strong-shod. The prey of fear, he, always
 curtailed, extinguished, thwarted by the dusk, work 
 partly done,
 says to the alternating blaze,
 "Again the sun!
 anew each day; and new and new and new,
 that comes into and steadies my soul."

The Paper Nautilus (1941)
Marianne Moore
For authorities whose hopes
are shaped by mercenaries?
 Writers entrapped by 
 teatime fame and by
commuters’ comforts? Not for these
 the paper nautilus
 constructs her thin glass shell.
 Giving her perishable 
souvenir of hope, a dull
 white outside and smooth-
 edged inner surface
glossy as the sea, the watchful
 maker of it guards it
 day and night; she scarcely
 eats until the eggs are hatched.
Buried eight-fold in her eight
 arms, for she is in
 a sense of devil-
fish, her glass ram’s horn-cradled freight
 is hid but is not crushed;
 as Hercules, bitten
 by a crab loyal to the hydra,
was hindered to succeed,
 the intensively 
 watched eggs coming from
the shell free it when they are freed,–
 leaving its wasp-nest flaws
 of white on white, and close-
 laid Ionic chiton-folds
like the lines in the mane of
 a Parthenon horse,
 round which the arms had
wound themselves as if they knew love
 is the only fortress
 strong enough to trust to.

His Shield (1951)
Marianne Moore
The pin-swin or spine-swine
 	(the edgehog miscalled hedgehog) with all his edges out,
    echidna and echinoderm in distressed-
pin-cushion thorn-fur coats, the spiny pig or porcupine,
 	the rhino with horned snout–
    everything is battle-dressed.

Pig-fur won’t do, I’ll wrap
 	myself in salamander-skin like Presbyter John.
    A lizard in the midst of flames, a firebrand
that is life, asbestos-eyed asbestos-eared, with tattooed nap
 	and permanent pig on
    the instep; he can withstand

fire and won’t drown. In his
	 unconquerable country of unpompous gusto,
    gold was so common none considered it; greed
and flattery were unknown. Though rubies large as tennis-
	 balls conjoined in streams so
    that the mountain seemed to bleed,

the inextinguishable 
	 salamander styled himself but presbyter. His shield
    was his humility. In Carpasian
linen coat, flanked by his household lion-cubs and sable
	 retinue, he revealed
    a formula safer than

an armorer’s: the power of relinquishing 
	 what one would keep; that is freedom. Become dinosaur-
    skulled, quilled or salamander-wooled, more ironshod
and javelin-dressed than a hedgehog battalion of steel, but be
	 dull. Don’t be envied or
   armed with a measuring rod.

Baseball and Writing (1961)
Marianne Moore
Fanaticism?  No.  Writing is exciting
and baseball is like writing.
   You can never tell with either
      how it will go
      or what you will do;
   generating excitement--
   a fever in the victim--
   pitcher, catcher, fielder, batter.

 Victim in what category?
Owlman watching from the press box?
 To whom does it apply?
 Who is excited?  Might it be I?
 
It's a pitcher's battle all the way--a duel--
a catcher's, as, with cruel
   puma paw, Elston Howard lumbers lightly
      back to plate.  (His spring 
      de-winged a bat swing.)
   They have that killer instinct;
   yet Elston--whose catching
   arm has hurt them all with the bat--
 when questioned, says, unenviously,
   "I'm very satisfied.  We won."
 Shorn of the batting crown, says, "We";
 robbed by a technicality.
 
When three players on a side play three positions
and modify conditions,
   the massive run need not be everything.
      "Going, going . . . "  Is
      it?  Roger Maris
   has it, running fast.  You will
   never see a finer catch.  Well . . .
   "Mickey, leaping like the devil"--why
 gild it, although deer sounds better--
snares what was speeding towards its treetop nest,
 one-handing the souvenir-to-be
 meant to be caught by you or me.
 
Assign Yogi Berra to Cape Canaveral;
he could handle any missile.
   He is no feather.  "Strike! . . . Strike two!"
      Fouled back.  A blur.
      It's gone.  You would infer
   that the bat had eyes.
   He put the wood to that one.
Praised, Skowron says, "Thanks, Mel.
   I think I helped a little bit."
 All business, each, and modesty.
        Blanchard, Richardson, Kubek, Boyer.
 In that galaxy of nine, say which
 won the pennant?  Each.  It was he.
 
Those two magnificent saves from the knee-throws
by Boyer, finesses in twos--
   like Whitey's three kinds of pitch and pre-
      diagnosis
   Pitching is a large subject. 
      with pick-off psychosis.
   Your arm, too true at first, can learn to
   catch your corners--even trouble
 Mickey Mantle.  ("Grazed a Yankee!
My baby pitcher, Montejo!"
 With some pedagogy,
 you'll be tough, premature prodigy.)
 
They crowd him and curve him and aim for the knees.  Trying
indeed!  The secret implying:
   "I can stand here, bat held steady."
      One may suit him;
       none has hit him.
   Imponderables smite him.
   Muscle kinks, infections, spike wounds
   require food, rest, respite from ruffians.  (Drat it!
 Celebrity costs privacy!)
Cow's milk, "tiger's milk," soy milk, carrot juice,
 brewer's yeast (high-potency--
 concentrates presage victory
 
sped by Luis Arroyo, Hector Lopez--
deadly in a pinch.  And "Yes,
   it's work; I want you to bear down,
      but enjoy it
      while you're doing it."
   Mr. Houk and Mr. Sain,
   if you have a rummage sale,
   don't sell Roland Sheldon or Tom Tresh.
 Studded with stars in belt and crown,
the Stadium is an adastrium.
 O flashing Orion,
          your stars are muscled like the lion.
