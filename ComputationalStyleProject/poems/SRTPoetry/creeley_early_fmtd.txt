Return
Robert Creeley
Quiet as is proper for such places;
The street, subdued, half-snow, half-rain,
Endless, but ending in the darkened doors.
Inside, they who will be there always,
Quiet as is proper for such people--
Enough for now to be here, and
To know my door is one of these.

Sanine to Leda
Robert Creeley
Beyond this road the blackness bends
in warmth. Two, then three or four,
lovers with wisdom for themselves
enough are sitting there in vague,
unbending poses. They sit.
The quiet grass holds roses.

Begin with that. The beautiful
comes later. Love, the several roses,
lovers with wisdom for themselves,
vague, unbending poses. Look.
Each loses what he chooses.

Love (1)

The thing comes
of itself
           (Look up
to see
       the cast & the squirrel,
                                the one
torn, a red thing,
                   & the other

mobiles:
                that the wind can catch at,
against itself,
                        a leaf or a contrivance of wires,
in the stairwell,
to be looked at from below.

We have arranged the form of a formula here,
have taken the heart out
                                        & the wind
is vague emotion.

To count on these aspirants
these contenders for the to-be-looked-at part
of these actions
                                these most hopeful movements
needs
a strong & constant wind.
                                        That will not rise above the speed
which we have calculated,
                                    that the leaf
remain
                that the wires
be not too much shaken.

as would any sound make
more music
            than this scraping
his violin is not love
is not even love lacking
a purpose or an object for

the ear and this has no shape)

For an Anniversary
Robert Creeley
Where you dream of water
I have held a handful of sand.

My manners are unprepossessing.
I stand her awkward, and a long time.

I am mainly an idiot.
You are almost beautiful.

We will both be miserable
but no one is damned
