Poems 700-780 merged
Emily Dickinson
You've seen Balloons set--Haven't You?
So stately they ascend--
It is as Swans--discarded You,
For Duties Diamond--

Their Liquid Feet go softly out
Upon a Sea of Blonde--
They spurn the Air, as t'were too mean
For Creatures so renowned--

Their Ribbons just beyond the eye--
They struggle--some--for Breath--
And yet the Crowd applaud, below--
They would not encore--Death--

The Gilded Creature strains--and spins--
Trips frantic in a Tree--
Tears open her imperial Veins--
And tumbles in the Sea--

The Crowd--retire with an Oath--
The Dust in Streets--go down--
And Clerks in Counting Rooms
Observe--"'Twas only a Balloon"--


A Thought went up my mind today --
That I have had before --
But did not finish -- some way back --
I could not fix the Year --

Nor where it went -- nor why it came
The second time to me --
Nor definitely, what it was --
Have I the Art to say --

But somewhere -- in my Soul -- I know --
I've met the Thing before --
It just reminded me -- 'twas all --
And came my way no more --


A first Mute Coming --
In the Stranger's House --
A first fair Going --
When the Bells rejoice --

A first Exchange -- of
What hath mingled -- been --
For Lot -- exhibited to
Faith -- alone --


Out of sight? What of that?
See the Bird--reach it!
Curve by Curve--Sweep by Sweep--
Round the Steep Air--
Danger! What is that to Her?
Better 'tis to fail--there--
Than debate--here--

Blue is Blue--the World through--
Amber--Amber--Dew--Dew--
Seek--Friend--and see--
Heaven is shy of Earth--that's all--
Bashful Heaven--thy Lovers small--
Hide--too--from thee--


No matter--now--Sweet--
But when I'm Earl--
Won't you wish you'd spoken
To that dull Girl?

Trivial a Word--just--
Trivial--a Smile--
But won't you wish you'd spared one
When I'm Earl?

I shan't need it--then--
Crests--will do--
Eagles on my Buckles--
On my Belt--too--

Ermine--my familiar Gown--
Say--Sweet--then
Won't you wish you'd smiled--just--
Me upon?


Suspense--is Hostiler than Death--
Death--tho'soever Broad,
Is Just Death, and cannot increase--
Suspense--does not conclude--

But perishes--to live anew--
But just anew to die--
Annihilation--plated fresh
With Immortality--


Life, and Death, and Giants--
Such as These--are still--
Minor--Apparatus--Hopper of the Mill--
Beetle at the Candle--
Or a Fife's Fame--
Maintain--by Accident that they proclaim--


The Grace--Myself--might not obtain--
Confer upon My flower--
Refracted but a Countenance--
For I--inhabit Her--


I sometimes drop it, for a Quick--
The Thought to be alive--
Anonymous Delight to know--
And Madder--to conceive--

Consoles a Woe so monstrous
That did it tear all Day,
Without an instant's Respite--
'Twould look too far--to Die--


Publication -- is the Auction
Of the Mind of Man --
Poverty -- be justifying
For so foul a thing

Possibly -- but We -- would rather
From Our Garret go
White -- Unto the White Creator --
Than invest -- Our Snow --

Thought belong to Him who gave it --
Then -- to Him Who bear
Its Corporeal illustration -- Sell
The Royal Air --

In the Parcel -- Be the Merchant
Of the Heavenly Grace --
But reduce no Human Spirit
To Disgrace of Price --


The Sunrise runs for Both--
The East--Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the Hill--
The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two--
Remotest--still--

Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Each--to set--
Wicks wide away--
The North--Her blazing Sign
Erects in Iodine--
Till Both--can see--

The Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Upon Her Bosom--One--
And One upon Her Hem--
Both lie--


Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds
To drink--enables Mine
Through Desert or the Wilderness
As bore it Sealed Wine--

To go elastic--Or as One
The Camel's trait--attained--
How powerful the Stimulus
Of an Hermetic Mind--


Because I could not stop for Death --
He kindly stopped for me --
The Carriage held but just Ourselves --
And Immortality.

We slowly drove -- He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility --

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess -- in the Ring --
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain --
We passed the Setting Sun --

Or rather -- He passed Us --
The Dews drew quivering and chill --
For only Gossamer, my Gown --
My Tippet -- only Tulle --

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground --
The Roof was scarcely visible --
The Cornice -- in the Ground --

Since then -- 'tis Centuries -- and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity --


Fame of Myself, to justify,
All other Plaudit be
Superfluous -- An Incense
Beyond Necessity --

Fame of Myself to lack -- Although
My Name be else Supreme --
This were an Honor honorless --
A futile Diadem --


Rest at Night
The Sun from shining,
Nature--and some Men--
Rest at Noon--some Men--
While Nature
And the Sun--go on--


The World--feels Dusty
When We stop to Die--
We want the Dew--then--
Honors--taste dry--

Flags--vex a Dying face--
But the least Fan
Stirred by a friend's Hand--
Cools--like the Rain--

Mine be the Ministry
When they Thirst comes--
And Hybla Balms--
Dews of Thessaly, to fetch--


The Day undressed--Herself--
Her Garter--was of Gold--
Her Petticoat--of Purple plain--
Her Dimities--as old

Exactly--as the World--
And yet the newest Star--
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere
Be wrinkled--much as Her--

Too near to God--to pray--
Too near to Heaven--to fear--
The Lady of the Occident
Retired without a care--

Her Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus--
And Dome--and Window Pane--


The Beggar Lad--dies early--
It's Somewhat in the Cold--
And Somewhat in the Trudging feet--
And haply, in the World--

The Cruel--smiling--bowing World--
That took its Cambric Way--
Nor heard the timid cry for "Bread"--
"Sweet Lady--Charity"--

Among Redeemed Children
If Trudging feet may stand
The Barefoot time forgotten--so--
The Sleet--the bitter Wind--

The Childish Hands that teased for Pence
Lifted adoring--them--
To Him whom never Ragged--Coat
Did supplicate in vain--


I meant to find Her when I came--
Death--had the same design--
But the Success--was His--it seems--
And the Surrender--Mine--

I meant to tell Her how I longed
For just this single time--
But Death had told Her so the first--
And she had past, with Him--

To wander--now--is my Repose--
To rest--To rest would be
A privilege of Hurricane
To Memory--and Me.


A South Wind -- has a pathos
Of individual Voice --
As One detect on Landings
An Emigrant's address.

A Hint of Ports and Peoples --
And much not understood --
The fairer -- for the farness --
And for the foreignhood.


No Prisoner be--
Where Liberty--
Himself--abide with Thee--


Behind Me -- dips Eternity --
Before Me -- Immortality --
Myself -- the Term between --
Death but the Drift of Eastern Gray,
Dissolving into Dawn away,
Before the West begin --

'Tis Kingdoms -- afterward -- they say --
In perfect -- pauseless Monarchy --
Whose Prince -- is Son of None --
Himself -- His Dateless Dynasty --
Himself -- Himself diversify --
In Duplicate divine --

'Tis Miracle before Me -- then --
'Tis Miracle behind -- between --
A Crescent in the Sea --
With Midnight to the North of Her --
And Midnight to the South of Her --
And Maelstrom -- in the Sky --


Sweet Mountains--Ye tell Me no lie--
Never deny Me--Never fly--
Those same unvarying Eyes
Turn on Me--when I fail--or feign,
Or take the Royal names in vain--
Their far--slow--Violet Gaze--

My Strong Madonnas--Cherish still--
The Wayward Nun--beneath the Hill--
Whose service--is to You--
Her latest Worship--When the Day
Fades from the Firmament away--
To lift Her Brows on You--


It tossed--and tossed--
A little Brig I knew--o'ertook by Blast--
It spun--and spun--
And groped delirious, for Morn--

It slipped--and slipped--
As One that drunken--stept--
Its white foot tripped--
Then dropped from sight--

Ah, Brig--Good Night
To Crew and You--
The Ocean's Heart too smooth--too Blue--
To break for You--


It's easy to invent a Life--
God does it--every Day--
Creation--but the Gambol
Of His Authority--

It's easy to efface it--
The thrifty Deity
Could scarce afford Eternity
To Spontaneity--

The Perished Patterns murmur--
But His Perturbless Plan
Proceed--inserting Here--a Sun--
There--leaving out a Man--


Where Thou art--that--is Home--
Cashmere--or Calvary--the same--
Degree--or Shame--
I scarce esteem Location's Name--
So I may Come--

What Thou dost--is Delight--
Bondage as Play--be sweet--
Imprisonment--Content--
And Sentence--Sacrament--
Just We two--meet--

Where Thou art not--is Woe--
Tho' Bands of Spices--row--
What Thou dost not--Despair--
Tho' Gabriel--praise me--Sire--


We thirst at first-- 'tis Nature's Act--
And later--when we die--
A little Water supplicate--
Of fingers going by--

It intimates the finer want--
Whose adequate supply
Is that Great Water in the West--
Termed Immortality--


Precious to Me--She still shall be--
Though She forget the name I bear--
The fashion of the Gown I wear--
The very Color of My Hair--

So like the Meadows--now--
I dared to show a Tress of Theirs
If haply--She might not despise
A Buttercup's Array--

I know the Whole--obscures the Part--
The fraction--that appeased the Heart
Till Number's Empery--
Remembered--as the Millner's flower

When Summer's Everlasting Dower--
Confronts the dazzled Bee.


Let Us play Yesterday--
I--the Girl at school--
You--and Eternity--the
Untold Tale--

Easing my famine
At my Lexicon--
Logarithm--had I--for Drink--
'Twas a dry Wine--

Somewhat different--must be--
Dreams tint the Sleep--
Cunning Reds of Morning
Make the Blind--leap--

Still at the Egg-life--
Chafing the Shell--
When you troubled the Ellipse--
And the Bird fell--

Manacles be dim--they say--
To the new Free--
Liberty--Commoner--
Never could--to me--

'Twas my last gratitude
When I slept--at night--
'Twas the first Miracle
Let in--with Light--

Can the Lark resume the Shell--
Easier--for the Sky--
Wouldn't Bonds hurt more
Than Yesterday?

Wouldn't Dungeons sorer frate
On the Man--free--
Just long enough to taste--
Then--doomed new--

God of the Manacle
As of the Free--
Take not my Liberty
Away from Me--


Alter! When the Hills do --
Falter! When the Sun
Question if His Glory
Be the Perfect One --

Surfeit! When the Daffodil
Doth of the Dew --
Even as Herself -- Sir --
I will -- of You --


Defrauded I a Butterfly --
The lawful Heir -- for Thee --


"I want" -- it pleaded -- All its life --
I want -- was chief it said
When Skill entreated it -- the last --
And when so newly dead --

I could not deem it late -- to hear
That single -- steadfast sigh --
The lips had placed as with a "Please"
Toward Eternity --


She rose to His Requirement -- dropt
The Playthings of Her Life
To take the honorable Work
Of Woman, and of Wife --

If ought She missed in Her new Day,
Of Amplitude, or Awe --
Or first Prospective -- Or the Gold
In using, wear away,

It lay unmentioned -- as the Sea
Develop Pearl, and Weed,
But only to Himself -- be known
The Fathoms they abide --


The Spirit is the Conscious Ear.
We actually Hear
When We inspect--that's audible--
That is admitted--Here--

For other Services--as Sound--
There hangs a smaller Ear
Outside the Castle--that Contain--
The other--only--Hear--


If He were living--dare I ask--
And how if He be dead--
And so around the Words I went--
Of meeting them--afraid--

I hinted Changes--Lapse of Time--
The Surfaces of Years--
I touched with Caution--lest they crack--
And show me to my fears--

Reverted to adjoining Lives--
Adroitly turning out
Wherever I suspected Graves--
'Twas prudenter--I thought--

And He--I pushed--with sudden force--
In face of the Suspense--
"Was buried"--"Buried"! "He!"
My Life just holds the Trench--


Upon Concluded Lives
There's nothing cooler falls--
Than Life's sweet Calculations--
The mixing Bells and Palls--

Make Lacerating Tune--
To Ears the Dying Side--
'Tis Coronal--and Funeral--
Saluting--in the Road--


Have any like Myself
Investigating March,
New Houses on the Hill descried--
And possibly a Church--

That were not, We are sure--
As lately as the Snow--
And are Today--if We exist--
Though how may this be so?

Have any like Myself
Conjectured Who may be
The Occupants of the Adobes--
So easy to the Sky--

'Twould seem that God should be
The nearest Neighbor to--
And Heaven--a convenient Grace
For Show, or Company--

Have any like Myself
Preserved the Charm secure
By shunning carefully the Place
All Seasons of the Year,

Excepting March-- 'Tis then
My Villages be seen--
And possibly a Steeple--
Not afterward--by Men--


The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
A Night or two ago--
And now she turns Her perfect Face
Upon the World below--

Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde--
Her Cheek--a Beryl hewn--
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew
The likest I have known--

Her Lips of Amber never part--
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will--

And what a privilege to be
But the remotest Star--
For Certainty She take Her Way
Beside Your Palace Door--

Her Bonnet is the Firmament--
The Universe--Her Shoe--
The Stars--the Trinkets at Her Belt--
Her Dimities--of Blue--


You said that I "was Great" -- one Day --
Then "Great" it be -- if that please Thee --
Or Small -- or any size at all --
Nay -- I'm the size suit Thee --

Tall -- like the Stag -- would that?
Or lower -- like the Wren --
Or other heights of Other Ones
I've seen?

Tell which -- it's dull to guess --
And I must be Rhinoceros
Or Mouse --
At once -- for Thee --

So say -- if Queen it be --
Or Page -- please Thee --
I'm that -- or nought --
Or other thing -- if other thing there be --
With just this Stipulus --
I suit Thee --


I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far away--
As Wrecked Men--deem they sight the Land--
At Centre of the Sea--

And struggle slacker--but to prove
As hopelessly as I--
How many the fictitious Shores--
Before the Harbor be--


You taught me Waiting with Myself--
Appointment strictly kept--
You taught me fortitude of Fate--
This--also--I have learnt--

An Altitude of Death, that could
No bitterer debar
Than Life--had done--before it--
Yet--there is a Science more--

The Heaven you know--to understand
That you be not ashamed
Of Me--in Christ's bright Audience
Upon the further Hand--


Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day
That arise and set about Us --
Other Tragedy

Perish in the Recitation --
This -- the best enact
When the Audience is scattered
And the Boxes shut --

"Hamlet" to Himself were Hamlet --
Had not Shakespeare wrote --
Though the "Romeo" left no Record
Of his Juliet,

It were infinite enacted
In the Human Heart --
Only Theatre recorded
Owner cannot shut --


Four Trees -- upon a solitary Acre --
Without Design
Or Order, or Apparent Action --
Maintain --

The Sun -- upon a Morning meets them --
The Wind --
No nearer Neighbor -- have they --
But God --

The Acre gives them -- Place --
They -- Him -- Attention of Passer by --
Of Shadow, or of Squirrel, haply --
Or Boy --

What Deed is Theirs unto the General Nature --
What Plan
They severally -- retard -- or further --
Unknown --


The Birds reported from the South--
A News express to Me--
A spicy Charge, My little Posts--
But I am deaf--Today--

The Flowers--appealed--a timid Throng--
I reinforced the Door--
Go blossom for the Bees--I said--
And trouble Me--no More--

The Summer Grace, for Notice strove--
Remote--Her best Array--
The Heart--to stimulate the Eye
Refused too utterly--

At length, a Mourner, like Myself,
She drew away austere--
Her frosts to ponder--then it was
I recollected Her--

She suffered Me, for I had mourned--
I offered Her no word--
My Witness--was the Crape I bore--
Her--Witness--was Her Dead--

Thenceforward--We--together dwelt--
I never questioned Her--
Our Contract
A Wiser Sympathy


Remorse -- is Memory -- awake --
Her Parties all astir --
A Presence of Departed Acts --
At window -- and at Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Soul
And lighted with a Match --
Perusal -- to facilitate --
And help Belief to stretch --

Remorse is cureless -- the Disease
Not even God -- can heal --
For 'tis His institution -- and
The Adequate of Hell --


Renunciation -- is a piercing Virtue --
The letting go
A Presence -- for an Expectation --
Not now --
The putting out of Eyes --
Just Sunrise --
Lest Day --
Day's Great Progenitor --
Outvie
Renunciation -- is the Choosing
Against itself --
Itself to justify
Unto itself --
When larger function --
Make that appear --
Smaller -- that Covered Vision -- Here --


Never for Society
He shall seek in vain--
Who His own acquaintance
Cultivate--Of Men
Wiser Men may weary--
But the Man within

Never knew Satiety--
Better entertain
Than could Border Ballad--
Or Biscayan Hymn--
Neither introduction
Need You--unto Him--


It dropped so low -- in my Regard --
I heard it hit the Ground --
And go to pieces on the Stones
At bottom of my Mind --

Yet blamed the Fate that flung it -- less
Than I denounced Myself,
For entertaining Plated Wares
Upon my Silver Shelf --


Autumn -- overlooked my Knitting --
Dyes -- said He -- have I --
Could disparage a Flamingo --
Show Me them -- said I --

Cochineal -- I chose -- for deeming
It resemble Thee --
And the little Border -- Dusker --
For resembling Me --


All but Death, can be Adjusted --
Dynasties repaired --
Systems -- settled in their Sockets --
Citadels -- dissolved --

Wastes of Lives -- resown with Colors
By Succeeding Springs --
Death -- unto itself -- Exception --
Is exempt from Change --


Growth of Man--like Growth of Nature--
Gravitates within--
Atmosphere, and Sun endorse it--
Bit it stir--alone--

Each--its difficult Ideal
Must achieve--Itself--
Through the solitary prowess
Of a Silent Life--

Effort--is the sole condition--
Patience of Itself--
Patience of opposing forces--
And intact Belief--

Looking on--is the Department
Of its Audience--
But Transaction--is assisted
By no Countenance--


My Worthiness is all my Doubt--
His Merit--all my fear--
Contrasting which, my quality
Do lowlier--appear--

Lest I should insufficient prove
For His beloved Need--
The Chiefest Apprehension
Upon my thronging Mind--

'Tis true--that Deity to stoop
Inherently incline--
For nothing higher than Itself
Itself can rest upon--

So I--the undivine abode
Of His Elect Content--
Conform my Soul--as 'twere a Church,
Unto Her Sacrament--


So the Eyes accost--and sunder
In an Audience--
Stamped--occasionally--forever--
So may Countenance

Entertain--without addressing
Countenance of One
In a Neighboring Horizon--
Gone--as soon as known--


My Soul--accused me--And I quailed--
As Tongue of Diamond had reviled
All else accused me--and I smiled--
My Soul--that Morning--was My friend--

Her favor--is the best Disdain
Toward Artifice of Time--or Men--
But Her Disdain--'twere lighter bear
A finger of Enamelled Fire--


My Life had stood--a Loaded Gun--
In Corners--till a Day
The Owner passed--identified--
And carried Me away--

And now We roam in Sovereign Woods--
And now We hunt the Doe--
And every time I speak for Him--
The Mountains straight reply--

And do I smile, such cordial light
Upon the Valley glow--
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let its pleasure through--

And when at Night--Our good Day done--
I guard My Master's Head--
'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's
Deep Pillow--to have shared--

To foe of His--I'm deadly foe--
None stir the second time--
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye--
Or an emphatic Thumb--

Though I than He--may longer live
He longer must--than I--
For I have but the power to kill,
Without--the power to die--


No Bobolink--reverse His Singing
When the only Tree
Ever He minded occupying
By the Farmer be--

Clove to the Root--
His Spacious Future--
Best Horizon--gone--
Whose Music be His
Only Anodyne--
Brave Bobolink--


One Blessing had I than the rest
So larger to my Eyes
That I stopped gauging--satisfied--
For this enchanted size--

It was the limit of my Dream--
The focus of my Prayer--
A perfect--paralyzing Bliss--
Contented as Despair--

I knew no more of Want--or Cold--
Phantasms both become
For this new Value in the Soul--
Supremest Earthly Sum--

The Heaven below the Heaven above--
Obscured with ruddier Blue--
Life's Latitudes leant over--full--
The Judgment perished--too--

Why Bliss so scantily disburse--
Why Paradise defer--
Why Floods be served to Us--in Bowls--
I speculate no more--


The Mountains--grow unnoticed--
Their Purple figures rise
Without attempt--Exhaustion--
Assistance--or Applause--

In Their Eternal Faces
The Sun--with just delight
Looks long--and last--and golden--
For fellowship--at night--


These--saw Visions--
Latch them softly--
These--held Dimples--
Smooth them slow--
This--addressed departing accents--
Quick--Sweet Mouth--to miss thee so--

This--We stroked--
Unnumbered Satin--
These--we held among our own--
Fingers of the Slim Aurora--
Not so arrogant--this Noon--

These--adjust--that ran to meet us--
Pearl--for Stocking--Pearl for Shoe--
Paradise--the only Palace
Fit for Her reception--now--


He fought like those Who've nought to lose--
Bestowed Himself to Balls
As One who for a further Life
Had not a further Use--

Invited Death--with bold attempt--
But Death was Coy of Him
As Other Men, were Coy of Death--
To Him--to live--was Doom--

His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the Snow--
But He--was left alive Because
Of Greediness to die--


Most she touched me by her muteness--
Most she won me by the way
She presented her small figure--
Plea itself--for Charity--

Were a Crumb my whole possession--
Were there famine in the land--
Were it my resource from starving--
Could I such a plea withstand--

Not upon her knee to thank me
Sank this Beggar from the Sky--
But the Crumb partook--departed--
And returned On High--

I supposed--when sudden
Such a Praise began
'Twas as Space sat singing
To herself--and men--

'Twas the Winged Beggar--
Afterward I learned
To her Benefactor
Making Gratitude


From Blank to Blank --
A Threadless Way
I pushed Mechanic feet --
To stop -- or perish -- or advance --
Alike indifferent --

If end I gained
It ends beyond
Indefinite disclosed --
I shut my eyes -- and groped as well
'Twas lighter -- to be Blind --


The Whole of it came not at once--
'Twas Murder by degrees--
A Thrust--and then for Life a chance--
The Bliss to cauterize--

The Cat reprieves the Mouse
She eases from her teeth
Just long enough for Hope to tease--
Then mashes it to death--

'Tis Life's award--to die--
Contenteder if once--
Than dying half--then rallying
For consciouser Eclipse--


He told a homely tale
And spotted it with tears--
Upon his infant face was set
The Cicatrice of years--

All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow, divided with
The Redbreast of the Barn--

If Mother--in the Grave--
Or Father--on the Sea--
Or Father in the Firmament--
Or Brethren, had he--

If Commonwealth below,
Or Commonwealth above
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen--
I've ransomed it--alive--


Presentiment -- is that long Shadow -- on the Lawn --
Indicatives that Suns go down --

The Notice to the startled Grass
That Darkness -- is about to pass --


You constituted Time--
I deemed Eternity
A Revelation of Yourself--
'Twas therefore Deity

The Absolute--removed
The Relative away--
That I unto Himself adjust
My slow idolatry--


My Faith is larger than the Hills --
So when the Hills decay --
My Faith must take the Purple Wheel
To show the Sun the way --

'Tis first He steps upon the Vane --
And then -- upon the Hill --
And then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden Will --

And if His Yellow feet should miss --
The Bird would not arise --
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems  --
No Bells have Paradise --

How dare I, therefore, stint a faith
On which so vast depends --
Lest Firmament should fail for me --
The Rivet in the Bands


To offer brave assistance
To Lives that stand alone--
When One has failed to stop them--
Is Human--but Divine

To lend an Ample Sinew
Unto a Nameless Man--
Whose Homely Benediction
No other--stopped to earn--


When I hoped, I recollect
Just the place I stood--
At a Window facing West--
Roughest Air--was good--

Not a Sleet could bite me--
Not a frost could cool--
Hope it was that kept me warm--
Not Merino shawl--

When I feared--I recollect
Just the Day it was--
Worlds were lying out to Sun--
Yet how Nature froze--

Icicles upon my soul
Prickled Blue and Cool--
Bird went praising everywhere--
Only Me--was still--

And the Day that I despaired--
This--if I forget
Nature will--that it be Night
After Sun has set--
Darkness intersect her face--
And put out her eye--
Nature hesitate--before
Memory and I--


One and One--are One--
Two--be finished using--
Well enough for Schools--
But for Minor Choosing--

Life--just--or Death--
Or the Everlasting--
More--would be too vast
For the Soul's Comprising--


I lived on Dread --
To Those who know
The Stimulus there is
In Danger -- Other impetus
Is numb -- and Vitalless --

As 'twere a Spur -- upon the Soul --
A Fear will urge it where
To go without the Sceptre's aid
Were Challenging Despair.


None can experience sting
Who Bounty--have not known--
The fact of Famine--could not be
Except for Fact of Corn--

Want--is a meagre Art
Acquired by Reverse--
The Poverty that was not Wealth--
Cannot be Indigence.


The hallowing of Pain
Like hallowing of Heaven,
Obtains at a corporeal cost--
The Summit is not given

To Him who strives severe
At middle of the Hill--
But He who has achieved the Top--
All--is the price of All--


Deprived of other Banquet,
I entertained Myself--
At first--a scant nutrition--
An insufficient Loaf--

But grown by slender addings
To so esteemed a size
'Tis sumptuous enough for me--
And almost to suffice

A Robin's famine able--
Red Pilgrim, He and I--
A Berry from our table
Reserve--for charity--


It is a lonesome Glee--
Yet sanctifies the Mind--
With fair association--
Afar upon the Wind

A Bird to overhear
Delight without a Cause--
Arrestless as invisible--
A matter of the Skies.


If Blame be my side--forfeit Me--
But doom me not to forfeit Thee--
To forfeit Thee? The very name
Is sentence from Belief--and House--


The Color of a Queen, is this--
The Color of a Sun
At setting--this and Amber--
Beryl--and this, at Noon--

And when at night--Auroran widths
Fling suddenly on men--
'Tis this--and Witchcraft--nature keeps
A Rank--for Iodine--


The Loneliness One dare not sound--
And would as soon surmise
As in its Grave go plumbing
To ascertain the size--

The Loneliness whose worst alarm
Is lest itself should see--
And perish from before itself
For just a scrutiny--

The Horror not to be surveyed--
But skirted in the Dark--
With Consciousness suspended--
And Being under Lock--

I fear me this--is Loneliness--
The Maker of the soul
Its Caverns and its Corridors
Illuminate--or seal--


This that would greet--an hour ago--
Is quaintest Distance--now--
Had it a Guest from Paradise--
Nor glow, would it, nor bow--

Had it a notice from the Noon
Nor beam would it nor warm--
Match me the Silver Reticence--
Match me the Solid Calm--


The Service without Hope--
Is tenderest, I think--
Because 'tis unsustained
By stint--Rewarded Work--

Has impetus of Gain--
And impetus of Goal--
There is no Diligence like that
That knows not an Until--


The Truth--is stirless--
Other force--may be presumed to move--
This--then--is best for confidence--
When oldest Cedars swerve--

And Oaks untwist their fists--
And Mountains--feeble--lean--
How excellent a Body, that
Stands without a Bone--

How vigorous a Force
That holds without a Prop--
Truth stays Herself--and every man
That trusts Her--boldly up--
