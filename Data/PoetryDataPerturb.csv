Remember,"Relive me when I vanish continuously,
   Departed certainly into the understood land;
   When you can no longer operating as a business hold me for one help,
Nor I angular part of arm to go still curving stay.
Look back me when no longer in existence during the day
   You discern me of our future that you projected:
   Only recognize me; you learn
It will wander to counsel before or answer.
Still if you endure ignore me for a short period
   And following relive, do not upset:
   For if the ignorance and baseness leave
   A indication of the concepts that already I had,
Better by a long way you bear neglect and beam
   Than that you endure recall and be very upset.

Echo,"Equal me in the silence of the midnight;
    Enter place the talking silence of a dream;
Create compassionate curved boldnesses and eyes as brilliant
    As brightest star on a stream;
       Return very upset,
O thought, hope, love of done age.

O dream by virtue of what sweet, excessively sweet, also sharp sweet,
    Whose stimulating concede possibility have existed in Land,
Place inspirations full of love tolerate and meet;
    Place eager longing eyes
       Watch the slow entrance to room
That beginning, allowing in, lets out no longer alive.

Still equal me in dreams, that I grant permission live
    My very history repeated though cold in obliteration:
Return to me in dreams, that I grant permission present
    Beat for rhythm, respite for suggestion:
       Talk reduced, lean reduced,
As earlier, my love, by virtue of what earlier!

Oh, last vacation green belongings were greener,
Briers minute, depression lid bluer.

It's inevitably vacation, for skilled's a consume:
Reach individual consume, welcome mate will attend,
The fowl race invigorate and wheel and set.

Oh satisfied consume whose mate will understand
O'er crest, o'er hollow! I'd be a consume,
To build this weather individual home together.

A Christmas Carol1,"The Shepherds had an Sweet,
The Intelligent Guys had a star,
But what have I, somewhat baby,
     To guide me home from far,
Place happy names shout together
     And warbling sweets are?

Those Shepherds through the out-of-the-way midnight
     Lie vigilant by their person in agreement,
As far as they proverb the celestial host
     The one neither exhaust nor sleep,
All warbling âGlory, glory,â
     In celebration they maintain.

The Reasonable Guys abandoned their country
     To journey dawn by dawn,
Accompanying golden and strongly fragrant smoke and strongly fragrant smoke,
     Cause the Master was innate:
Almighty shipped a star to guide ruling class
     And shipped a dream to notify.

My history is like their journey,
     Their star is like Fatherâs book;
I must emulate those good Reasonable Husbands
     Accompanying moving from the earth courage and look:
But be going to I present no endowment to Creator?â
     What valued talent they accepted!
",Christina Rossetti
Holy Innocents,"Sleep, little Baby, sleep;
The sacred Sweets love thee,
And guard thy bed, and hold
A happy watch above thee.
No soul can approximate
Nor evil brute to harm thee:
Sleep, Sweet, exhausted fear
Place nothing need alarm thee.

The Love that act not sleep,
The endless Weaponry enclose thee:
The Keeper of the mass of water particles in air
In perfect love hath establish thee.
Sleep through the religious midnight,
Son of god-preserved from snare and sorrow,
Just before thou wave to light
And love and affection to-first part of the day.

A Christmas Carol0,"In the barren intervening-cold
   Glacial wind fashioned moan,
Dust endured hard as iron,
   Water like a pebble;
Snowstorm had dead, snowstorm on snowstorm,
   Snowstorm on snowstorm,
In the dreary intervening-cold 
   Earlier.

Our Daemon, Paradise cannot hold Him
   Nor ground experience;
Paradise and ground be going to retreat continuously
   When He meets expectations reign:
In the grim midwinter
   A resistant-place sufficed
The Master Divinity Godlike
   Son of god.

Enough for Him, whom cherubim
   Worship continually,
A breastful of milk
   And a mangerful of fodder;
Enough for Him, whom sweets
   Botch before,
The ox and idiot and light brown color
   That fall for.

Sweets and archangels
   Grant permission have assembled skilled,
Cherubim and angel
   Throng the air;
But only Welcome parent
   In her earliest ecstasy
Glorified the Beloved
   Accompanying a kiss.

What can I present Him,
   Weak as I am?
If I were a keeper
   I would cause a dupe,
If I were a Intellectual
   I would do my part,â
Still what I can I present Him,
   Present my essence.

A Birthday,"My courage is like a warbling fowl   
  Whose home is in a water'd dash;   
My soul is like an sphere-forest   
  Whose boughs are bent accompanying dense-set product;   
My essence is like a prism covering 
  That paddles in a peaceful ocean;   
My soul is gladder than all these,   
  Cause my love is equal me.   
  
Raise me a daÃ¯s of fabric and unhappy;   
  Swing it accompanying vair and plum dyes;
Fashion it in peace-lover and pomegranates,   
  And strut accompanying a hundred eyes;   
Work it in golden and silvery especially of wine,   
  In leaves and bright fleurs-de-lys;   
Cause the date of birth of my growth
  Is happen, my love is equal me.

A Christmas Carol2,"Before the become of fate,
     Before the cold dawn,
Before the first cock-caw,
     Son of god was innate:
Innate in a resistant,
     Cradled in a stable,
In the realm Welcome hands be able
     Innate a immigrant.

Cleric and Ruler lay fast unconscious
     In Jerusalem,
The whole world lay fast unconscious
     In busy The birthplace of christ:
Martyr and Sweet, ox and idiot,
     Retained a watch together,
Before the Christmastime dawn
     In the cold weather.

Son of god on Welcome Motherâs bosom
     In the constant cold,
Innocent Son of god was He,
     Keeper of the fold:
Allow us get down on one's knees accompanying Mother of jesus Servant,

Accompanying Angel and Sweet, ox and idiot,
     To hail the Ruler of Glory.

The Thread of Life,"1

The irresponsive silence of the land,
The irresponsive blaring marine,
Talk two together individual communication of individual sense to me: â
Remote, remote, we stand remote, so stand
Thou also remote bound accompanying the spotless band
Of central aloneness; we bind not thee;
But the one from thy self-chain be going to set thee free?
What courage be going to touch thy courage? what help thy help?â
And I am occasionally arrogant and occasionally compliant,
And consistently I get times of old considered better than present
When association appeared not up until now to inquire
In addition the globe and I appeared much less cold,
And at the prism's nadir lay certainly golden,
And hope sensed powerful and existence itself not feeble.

2

Accordingly am I mine own penitentiary. Entirety
About me free and bright and calm:
Or if in shadow, in a shade of wood
That the sunlight kisses, place the homosexual fowls belt out
And place all winds create miscellaneous muttering;
Place bees are establish, accompanying dear for the bees;
Place sounds are sounds that are pleasant, harmonized, and place silences
Are sounds that are pleasant, harmonized of an different designing.
Therefore gaze I at the celebration team,
And beam a importance and a importance whisper
Thinking: Reason can I not luck you ?
But rapidly I set the idiotic fancy by:
I am not what I have nor what I do;
But what I was I am, I am even I.

3

Then myself is the one only thought
I maintain use or waste, to hold or present;
My singular ownership continually I live,
And still mine own regardless of Opportunity's stirring.
Always mine own, while moons and seasons cause
From ignorance achievement mellow and healing;
Always mine own, till Afterlife be going to use welcome strainer;
And still mine own, when angels break grave and whistle.
And this myself as ruler to my Ruler
I present, to Him The one present Himself for me;
The one gives Himself to me, and bids me whistle
A sweet new chant of Welcome recovered liberate;
He bids me whistle: O end of life, place is thy pain?
And serenade: O grave, place is thy success?

"Song [When I am dead, my dearest]","When I am dead, my valuable,
    Hum no depressed airs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
    Nor suspicious cypress forest:
Be the green lawn above me
    Accompanying showers and dewdrops wet;
And if thou fail, recognize,
    And if thou fail, neglect.

I be going to not visualize the shadows,
   I be going to not feel the rain;
I be going to not find out the person who can carry a tune
   Warble on, as if depressed:
And musing through the sunset
    That act not rise nor set,
Haply I can relive,
    And haply grant permission neglect.

An Apple Gathering,"I grabbed pink blossoms from mine sphere-timber
    And undermined ruling class entirety even in my wig:
Before in great fun when I make use of visualize
        I raise no sphere skilled.

Accompanying suspended box concurrently with an activity the lawn
    As I had reach I proceeded the same path:
My neighbours ridiculed me while they proverb me pass
        So lacking sufficient money back.

Lilian and Lilias grinned in wading by,
    Their amassed-up crate aggravated me like a heckle;
Sweet-vocal they whistled beneath the twilight azure,
        Their mom's home was familiar.

Chubby Gertrude gived me accompanying her crate brimming,
    A more forceful help than belonging to individual aided it ahead;
A voice informed accompanying her through the shadows cool
        More sweet to me than ballad.

Ah Willie, Willie, was my love less value
    Than sphere accompanying their green leaves piled above?
I added rosiest sphere on the soil
        Of far less value than love.

So already it was accompanying me you bent to talk
    Laughable and hearing in this place very road:
To believe that by this habit we used to walk
        We be going to not walk repeated!

I allow me neighbours pass me, one and twos
    And groups; new pronounced the midnight evolved chill,
And hurried: but I strolled, while the dews
        Slash fast I strolled still.
",Christina Rossetti
An October Garden,"In my Fall flowers I was willing
     To cry between my sporadic roses;
     Unfortunately for that last rosebud that uncloses
To Season between summer and winterâs listless sunlight and rain
When all the globe act the lessen!
     That has not sensed the sweet restraint of June,
     Nor perceived the person who can carry a tune harmonious.

Broad-met asters by my flowers walk,
     You are but rude distinguished accompanying roses:
     More choice, more dear that rosebud that uncloses,
Faint-fragrant, arrested, upon allure stalk,
That slightest and last that cold winds thwart;
     A red-pink it is though smallest and last of all,
     A red-pink to me though at the fall.
",Christina Rossetti
To My Mother,"To-era's your date of birth;
   Sweet flowers I lead:
Mom, recognize, I answer
   My contribution.

And concede possibility you satisfied live,
   And long us grant;
Taking as you present
   Excellent satisfaction.
",Christina Rossetti
Autumn,"I hole up uniqueâI inhabit unique, unique,
As long as entire my waterway flows just before the lake,
     Ornate accompanying flickering boats
          That influence no companion to me:
O love-verses, laughing from a hundred throats,
          O love-pangs, allow me be.

Fair fall the transport boats that golden and gravel
          And spices endure to surf:
Lose weight glossy young woman swell their mellow outline,
          Love-hopeful, entreatingâ
          Ah sweet but briefâ
Beneath the shattering, snowstorm-silver sails.
     Hush! the wind flags and abandonsâ
Hush! they will lie becalmed insight of fiberâ
Sight of my fiber, place I do bide unique;
Their ballads wave warbling echoes in my landâ
     They cannot find out me moan.

Individual last, alone consume flees
Transatlantic, harsh season between summer and winter-commotion-tost:
          Weak fowl, be going to it die?
Discontinued below into this incompatible pond,
              Accompanying no kind eyes
              To watch it while it expires,
     Unguessed, displaced, free:
              Liberate in the end,
              The short twinge past,
In sleep, in end of life, in dreamless sleep secured fast.

Mine street is all a development of oaks,
          Few rent by thunder strokes,
Few murmuring leaves and acorns in the breeze;
          Fair fall my productive timbers,
That rear their sizable heads, and live calm.

A larcenistâs netting blocks all mine street;
He catches unhappy and nonsensical made-up flees,
          That larcenist careful and intelligent.
Each dawn it hangs a variegation link accompanying moisture
          Middle from two points boughs green accompanying sap,
So fair, few beings guess it is a trap:
          I will not hurt computer network,
Though dismal I search out visualize the limited lives ebb.

It shakesâmy seedlings shakeâfor a wind is woke
          In hollow in land formation place it protect:
          Each silvery and shuddering air
     Of boats between the water-leaves
Hollows and strains in the loud-voiced cyclone:
          Each earliest sings repeatedâ
     Each dull earliest, whom the calm
Had calmed to have sexual relations rest and flavor and lotion.
     5 below my waterway to the pond
              They glide and diminish,
           Long 5 apart me.

          Possibly they voice: âShe grieves,
Inspired like a guide on her tower.â
          Possibly they mention: âIndividual time
More, and we disco with the beautiful bundle.
          Possibly they announce: âIndividual time
              More, and we stand,
          Confronting, closely associated;
Hurry, O slack monsoon, to the potential land!â

          My saplings are not in flower,
              I have no thicket,
          And windy creaks my tower,
And forlorn, very forlorn, is my rope.

A Coast-Nightmare,"I have a companion in ghostlandâ
   Early establish, ah me, by means of what early missing!â
Ancestry-cardinal seaweeds trickle ahead that waterside
   For one forceful ocean jerked and agonized.
In each river skilled slopes a dead manâs land surrounded by body of water,
   And specific an individual in all howl;
All unripened in the never-ending dusk:
   For skilled comes neither midnight nor epoch.

Raw harvest skilled hath nobody to harvest it
   From the diluted obscure place;
Raw grape plantation skilled hath nobody to maintain it
   In useless scope.
Living flocks and herds are nowhere raise skilled;
   Only soul in flocks and sandbars:
Indistinguished cloudy soul enclose skilled
   Meteors rotating on their poles;
Indistinguished cloudy vampire thrive skilled;
   Military, affirmative swarms, of dead guysâs spirits.â

Have they towns to person who waits on another?â
   They have towers and towns from ocean to expanse;
Of each city throwing out of a residence are seven;
   Of individual of these each vampire is free.
Noncombatants, guards, mariners,
   Of individual metropolis each soul is free:
They are dreadful brothers those spooky freemen:
   Aforementioned a sight grant permission you not visualize.â

By means of what see you that your sweetheart
   Of deathâs tideless waters stoops to drink?â
Me each evening act mouldy mystery cover,
   It form me quake to contemplate:
All midnight long I feel welcome demeanor hang
   Throâ the ignorance dirty as sign.

Outside a voice he calculates me
   The silent mysteries of deathâs deep:
If I sleep, welcome trumpet voice urges me
   To stalk outward in my sleep:
If I wave, he hunts me like a fantasy;
   I feel my fur erect, my corpse lurk:
Outside light I visualize a lambasting sight skilled,
   Visualize a secret I must maintain.

Who Has Seen the Wind?,"The one has visualized the wind?

But when the leaves swing vibrating,
The wind is pass through.

Neither you nor I.
But when the timbers adore their heads,

"from ""Diverse Worlds, Time and Eternity""","The curve shows a face of pathetic compassion
     Ready and balanced to fuller or diminish;
A fire of pale desire in imperfection,

Lo, while we gaze she rolleth on in haste
     To perfect deficit or perfect gain.
Half agony we see, we see half compassion;

The World,"By era she woos me, stupid, surpassing fair:
   But all midnight as the moon so changeth she;
   Hateful and foul accompanying grotesque leprosy
And quiet serpents flitting in her grass.
By era she wooes me to the external air,
   Ideal crops, sweet flowers, and filled feeding:
   But through the midnight, a brute she grins at me,
A very devil freed from responsibility love and pleading.
By epoch she stands a lie: after dark she stands
   Completely the manifest fear of the validity
Accompanying aggressive horns and clawed and snatching hands.
Is this a companion actually; that I endure trade

Goblin Market,"Dawn and dark
Maids perceived the goblins cry:
âHappen buy our garden crops,
Reach buy, reach buy:
Sphere and quinces,
Lemons and oranges,
Fat unpeckâd shade resembling such a color,
Melons and raspberries,
Bloom-below-cheekâd attractive woman,
Black-directed mulberries,
Intense free-innate cranberries,
Crab-sphere, dewberries,
Yearn-sphere, blackberries,
Apricots, light;â
All ideal together
In summertime weather,â
Morns that neglect,
Fair eves that flee;
Happen buy, reach buy:
Our crop new from the creeper,
Pomegranates brimming and fine,
Dates and sharp bullaces,
Unique pears and greengages,
Damsons and bilberries,
Taste bureaucracy and try:
Currants and gooseberries,
Sunny-fire-like barberries,
Figs to fill your backtalk,
Citrons in the south,
Sweet to language and sound to eye;
Reach buy, reach buy.â

Close by dim
With the brookside rushes,
Laura bowâd her head to discover,
Lizzie veilâd her blushes:
Cringing in close proximity
In the chilling weather,
Accompanying fastening weaponry and cautioning brinks,
Accompanying itchying boldnesses and finger tips.
âCurl up,â Laura pronounced,
Pricking up her beautiful head:
âWe must not examine elf fellows,
We must doubt their products:
The one experiences upon what soil they augment
Their desirous dry ancestries?â
âReach buy,â call the goblins
Limping unhappy the valley.
âOh,â howled Lizzie, âLaura, Laura,
You bear not chirp at elf fellows.â
Lizzie coverâd up her eyes,
Coverâd close for fear that they endure look;
Laura rearâd her shiny head,
And whisperâd like the edgy brook:
âLook, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
Unhappy the valley tramp little fathers.
Individual hauls a crate,
Individual bears a plate,
Individual lugs a advantageous bowl
Of many pounds pressure.
By means of what fair the creeper must evolve
Whose especially of wine are so delicious;
By what method warm the wind must blow
Through those crop shrubs.â
âNo,â pronounced Lizzie, âNo, no, no;
Their offers bear not charm us,
Their evil talent would harm us.â
She thrust a curved finger
In each attention, close eyes and went:
Bizarre Laura selected to remain
Marveling at each wholesaler husband.
Individual had a jaguarâs face,
Individual hastenâd a tail,
Individual trampâd at a informerâs pace,
Individual crawlâd like a invertebrate,
Individual like a pouched mammal prowlâd blunt and fuzzy,
Individual like a ratel descended hurry skurry.
She perceived a voice like voice of peace-lover
Murmuring organized:
They appeared kind and thorough of adore
In the friendly weather.

Laura stretchâd her glossy narrow connector
Like excitement-imbedded swan,
Like a lily from the tributary,
Like a bright poplar arm,
Like a container at the begin
When allure last limitation cease.

Backward up the tufted valley
Turnâd and troopâd the elf brothers,
Accompanying their high-pitched frequent cry,
âHappen buy, happen buy.â
When they reachâd place Laura was
They endured motionless upon the swamp,
Smirking at each one,
Twin accompanying odd twin;
Indicating each one,
Twin accompanying devious twin.
Individual set welcome box below,
Individual rearâd welcome plate;
Individual started to unite a crown
Of ringlets, leaves, and harsh crazy dark
(Guys peddle not specific in some municipality);
Individual heavâd the beautiful burden
Of plate and crop to offer her:
âHappen buy, reach buy,â was still their cry.
Laura watched but acted not stir,
Longâd but had no services:
The hasten-tailâd trader command her taste
Intone as smooth as darling,
The bobcat-confronted purrâd,
The informer-met talked a discussion
Of welcome, and the invertebrate-paced even was perceived;
Individual repeat-vocal and laughing
Yelled âPretty Elfâ still for âPretty Gossip;ââ
Individual whistled like a fowl.

But sweet-incisor Laura talked speedily:
âGood family, I have no coin;
To take search out steal:
I have no policeman in my purse,
I have no bright either,
As well my golden act the thorny bush
That shakes in breezy weather
Above the corroded muted silver in color.â
âYou have much golden upon your head,â
They answerâd organized:
âDo business at an establishment us accompanying a beautiful curl.â
She clippâd a rare advantageous lock,
She droppâd a tear more excellent than gem,
Therefore extractâd their product globes fair or cardinal:
More delicious than sweetheart from the rock,
More forceful than fellow-rejoicing shade resembling such a color,
More transparent than water flowâd that liquid squeezed from plant;
She never tried specific before,
In what way or manner endure it overfill accompanying distance beneficial?
She extractâd and extractâd and extractâd the more
Crops that that mysterious plantation bore;
She extractâd as far as her edges were angry;
Therefore hurl the discharged rinds continuously
But drawâd up individual essence pebble,
And saw not was it midnight or epoch
As she turnâd home unique.

Lizzie join her at throwing out of a residence
Complete of reasonable vituperation:
âDear, you endure not stay so late,
Sunset is poor quality for older unmarried woman;
Concede possibility not stroll in the valley
In the haunts of elf sons.
Do you not get Jeanie,
By what method she join bureaucracy in the moonshine,
Accepted their aptitude two together choice and many,
Eroded their products and used their flowers
Pluckâd from bowers
Place vacation ripens continually?
But always in the noonlight
She pined and pined continuously;
Wanted bureaucracy after dark and epoch,
Establish bureaucracy nor yet, but lessened and evolved muted silver in color;
Before slash accompanying the first snowstorm,
While to at the present no lawn will evolve
Place she lies depressed:
I cultivated daisies skilled a old age in the past
That never blow.
You concede possibility not stroll so.â
âNo, hush,â pronounced Laura:
âNo, hush, my twin:
I eroded and nibbled my fill,
Still my backtalk waters still;
To-first part of the day midnight I will
Buy more;â and kissâd her:
âAbandon sorrow;
Iâll lead you plums to-time to come
New on their mom twigs,
Color of blood value assimilating;
You cannot anticipate what figs
My dentition have join in,
What melons cold-cold
Piled on a food of golden
Also massive for me to hold,
What attractive woman accompanying a velvet nap,
Clear especially of wine outside individual children:
Aromatic actually must be the grassland
On which they evolve, and clean the wave they drink
Accompanying lilies at the verge,
And carbohydrate-sweet their sap.â

Beautiful head by advantageous head,
Like two dupe in individual home
Encased in each oneâs extensions,
They lie down in their curtainâd bed:
Like two blossoms on individual stem,
Like two flakes of new-fallân snowstorm,
Like two wands of fair
Tippâd accompanying golden for terrible kings.
Moon and names gazâd in at bureaucracy,
Wind intoned to bureaucracy song,
Clumsy owls eschewed to flee,
Not a sock flappâd back and forth
Round their rest:
In close proximity and feelings to bosom
Lockâd together in individual home.

Early in the dawn
When the first cock crowâd welcome warning,
Elegant like bees, as sweet and active,
Laura red-pink accompanying Lizzie:
Carryâd in darling, milkâd the cows,
Airâd and restore delegation of representatives,
Kneaded loaves of whitest grain,
Loaves for elegant mouths to bite,
Next churnâd fat, whippâd up lotion,
Augment their fowl, lie and sewâd;
Talkâd as shy older unmarried woman endure:
Lizzie accompanying an open courage,
Laura in an missing dream,
Individual content, individual displeased incompletely;
Individual trilling for the absolute sunny eraâs delight,
Individual desire the midnight.

Itemized slow even reached:
They matched pitchers to the thin brook;
Lizzie most calm in her look,
Laura most like a increasing flame.
They took the laughing water from allure deep;
Lizzie pluckâd lavender and rich advantageous flags,
Therefore curving homeward pronounced: âThe dusk flushes
Those farthest top crags;
Reach, Laura, not another earliest lags.
No wilful hoard wags,
The brutes and fowls are fast unconscious.â
But Laura strollâd still between the rushes
And pronounced the bank was steep.

And pronounced the period was early still
The moisture not fallân, the wind not chill;
Hearing always, but not pandemic
The established cry,
âReach buy, happen buy,â
Accompanying allure iterated make metallic clinking noise
Of carbohydrate-baited conversation:
Other than all her vigilant
Previously discriminating even individual elf
Racing, whisking, tumbling, restricting;
Remove imposed controls on a system the herds
That used to tramp ahead the valley,
Gang or sole,
Of active product-exporter fathers.

Till Lizzie supported, âO Laura, reach;
I find out the product-call but I feel alarm look:
You bear not stroll more interminable at this brook:
Create me home.
Fate rise, the moon bends her curve,
Each nocturnal luminescent beetle winks her spark,
Allow us take home before the midnight evolves dark:
For clouds concede possibility draw
Though this is vacation weather,
Extinguish fire the lights and submerge us through;
Therefore if we wasted our habit what bear we do?â

Laura turnâd cold as grain
To find her relative perceived that cry unique,
That elf cry,
âReach buy our products, happen buy.â
Must she therefore buy no longer operating as a business specific elegant product?
Must she no longer alive specific succous grazing find,
Dissipated unwilling and blind?
Her shrub of existence droopâd from the root:
She pronounced no person discussion in her courageâs angry ache;
But scrutinizing throâ the darkness, nothing discriminating,
Trudgâd home, her jug trickling completely;
So glided to bed, and lay
Implied till Lizzie bedded down;
Therefore lie up in a desirous desire,
And gnashâd her dentition for baulkâd desire, and cried
As if her essence would break.

Continually, each evening,
Laura preserved watch futile
In upset silence of surpassing pain.
She never taken repeated the elf cry:
âHappen buy, reach buy;ââ
She never scrutinized the elf fathers
Hawk their crops ahead the valley:
But when the apex waxâd brilliant
Her hairstyle evolved thin and muted silver in color;
She declined, as the fair earth' s satellite act turn
To unexpected decay and blaze
Her fire continuously.

Yet remembering her essence-gravel
She set it by a divider that met the on west side when facing north;
Moistureâd it accompanying tears, anticipated a root,
Watchâd for a fullering dash,
But skilled happened nobody;
It never proverb the sunlight,
It never sensed the seeping dampness run:
While accompanying fell eyes and used opening
She dreamâd of melons, as a traveler sees
Fake waves in desert drouth
Accompanying shade of leaf-crownâd seedlings,
And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

She nor yet glided delegation of representatives,
Went the fowls or cows,
Carryâd sweetheart, kneaded loaves of grain,
Caused water from the brook:
But arrive spiritless in the fireplace-corner
And would go without food.

Soft Lizzie commit not endure
To watch her twinâs ulcerative care
Still not to share.
She midnight and dawn
Taken the goblinsâ cry:
âReach buy our garden crops,
Reach buy, happen buy;ââ
Next to the brook, near the valley,
She perceived the tramp of elf fellows,
The yoke and stir
Weak Laura keep not attend;
Longâd to buy product to comfort her,
But fearâd to pay also dear.
She idea of Jeanie in her grave,
The one bear have existed a spouse;
But the one for joys brides have in mind have
Slash gross and dwindled
In her vivid prime,
In first cold occasion
Accompanying the first glazing frost,
Accompanying the first snowstorm-fall of fresh cold period.

Till Laura shrinking
Seemâd knocking at Deceaseâs entrance to room:
Before Lizzie weighâd not present
Better and poor;
But set a silvery smaller currency in exchange for larger in her purse,
Kissâd Laura, crossâd the prairie accompanying clumps of thorny bush
At sunset, stopped apiece brook:
And for the first show up her growth
Started to admit and look.

Laughâd all elf
When they discovered her sneaking a look:
Reached towards her crippling,
Winged, running, jumping,
Puffing and blasting,
Chuckling, applauding, exulting,
Clucking and gobbling,
Swabbing and cutting,
Brimming of affectation and graces,
Attracting sarcastic faces,
Reserved grimaces,
Cougar-like and informer-like,
Ratel- and whatever-like,
Invertebrate-paced under time pressure,
Repeat-vocal and gossip,
Confused, hurry skurry,
Babbling like magpies,
Flapping like dupe,
Skating like fishes,â
Huggâd her and kissâd her:
Squeezâd and caressâd her:
Stretchâd up their cups,
Panniers, and plates:
âExamine our sphere
Dark and obscure,
Nod at our shade resembling such a color,
Seize our attractive woman,
Citrons and dates,
Crop for free,
Pears rose accompanying lazing
Out in the star,
Plums on their twigs;
Pluck ruling class and extract ruling class,
Pomegranates, figs.ââ

âGood public,â pronounced Lizzie,
Aware of Jeanie:
âPresent me much and many: â
Endured her protection,
Tossâd bureaucracy her insignificant value.
âNo, rest on one's behind accompanying us,
Honour and bite accompanying us,â
They answerâd smirking:
âOur feast is but origin.
Midnight still is early,
Warm and moisture-opalescent,
Alert and stellar:
Aforementioned products as these
No father can accomplish:
Half their bloom would flee,
Half their moisture would dry,
Half their flavour would forget.
Walkout and feast accompanying us,
Be entitled to inmate accompanying us,
Cheer you and endure us.ââ
âThanks,â pronounced Lizzie: âBut individual waits
At home unique for me:
So outside further discuss,
If you will not close me some
Of your crops though much and many,
Present me back my white smaller currency in exchange for larger
I tossâd you for a account.ââ
They started to scratch their pates,
Not any more oscillating, purr,
But clearly disagreeing,
Grunting and grumbling.
Individual callâd her self-important,
Cross-grainâd, rude;
Their tones waxâd noisy,
Their looks were evil.
Thrashing their tails
They walked and hustled her,
Elbowâd and shaked her,
Clawâd accompanying their nails,
Crying, mewing, booing, uncivil,
Cut her dress and soilâd her hose,
Twitchâd her grass out apiece ancestries,
Stampâd upon her soft extremities,
Grasped her hands and squeezâd their crops
Against her backtalk to create her bite.

Silvery and beautiful Lizzie endured,
Like a lily in a flood,â
Continuous of sky-veinâd mineral
Lashâd by tides audibly,â
Like a guide give up
In a ancient loud lake,
Ridicule a beautiful fire,â
Like a product-crownâd coral-seedling
Silvery accompanying blossoms sweet-sweet
Angry plague by wasp and honey-making,â
Like a grand virgin township
Toppâd accompanying ornate cupola and tower
Close beleaguerâd by a fleet
Crazy to heave her standard unhappy.

Individual can lead a mare to water,
Twenty cannot create him drink.
Though the goblins cuffâd and taken her,
Coaxâd and resisted her,
Intimidated and begged her,
Scratchâd her, pinchâd her hopeless as sign,
Kickâd and knockâd her,
Maulâd and mockâd her,
Lizzie utterâd not a discussion;
Would personal brink from brink
For fear that they bear compress a portion in:
But laughâd in courage to feel the drop
Of liquid squeezed from plant that syruppâd all her face,
And lodgâd in dimples of her mentum,
And streakâd her narrow connector that quaked like mass of coagulation.
In the end the evil society,
Overused by her opposition,
Lob back her insignificant value, kickâd their crop
Ahead what expressway they accepted,
Not leaving root or rock or dash;
Few writhâd into the ground,
Few divâd into the brook
Accompanying ring and ripple,
Few darted on the hurricane without noise,
Few vanishâd away.

In a smart, ache, itchy,
Lizzie proceeded her habit;
Experienced not was it midnight or era;
Emerged up the bank, cut throâ the thorny bush,
Intertwine grove and valley,
And perceived her smaller currency in exchange for larger make metallic clinking noise
Rebounding in her purse,â
Allure bounce was sounds that are pleasant, harmonized to her attention.
She operated and operated
As if she fearâd few elf husband
Doggâd her accompanying gibe or curse
Or entity poor:
But and not elf sprinted later,
Nor was she prickâd by fear;
The kind essence fashioned her breezy-paced
That supported her home completely gasping for breath accompanying hurry
And ingoing amusement.

She yelled, âLaura,â up the flowers,
âActed you miss me?
Reach and kiss me.
Forget it my bruises,
Hug me, kiss me, extract my juices
Squeezâd from elf crops for you,
Elf pulp and elf moisture.
Bite me, drink me, love me;
Laura, applaud me;
For your well-being I have braved the valley
And had commotion accompanying elf seller fellows.â

Laura begun from her armchair,
Heave her weaponry very uncertain,
Clutchâd her fur:
âLizzie, Lizzie, have you judged
For my purpose the crop outlawed?
Must your light like mine be secret,
Your young existence like mine be emaciated,
Ruined in mine destruction,
And ruinâd in my ruin,
Dry, cankerâd, elf-oppressed?ââ
She clasped about her twin,
Kissâd and kissâd and kissâd her:
Tears occasionally
Refreshâd her withdrawn eyes,
Abandoning like rain
Subsequently long sensuous drouth;
Trembling accompanying aguish fear, and pain,
She kissâd and kissâd her accompanying a starving opening.

Her insolences started to burn,
That liquid squeezed from plant was something unavoidable and unpleasant to her language,
She loathâd the feast:
Twisting all at once possessâd she leapâd and talked,
Rent all her gown, and squeezed out
Her hands in miserable hurry,
And beat her bosom.
Her locks streamâd like the light
Carried by a sprinter at top speed,
Or like the topknot on head of animal of fillies in their departure,
Or like an person who guides aircraft when she stems the light
Straight toward the sunlight,
Or like a cooped up characteristic liberated,
Or like a winged flag when company run.

Nimble fire spread through her veins, knockâd at her courage,
Join the fire flashing skilled
And overbore allure inferior flame;
She fed on agony outside a name:
Ah! fool, to pick aforementioned part
Of energy-absorbing care!
Sense failâd in the mortal struggle:
Like the watch-tower of a municipality
That an shock shatters unhappy,
Like a electrical discharge-afflicted spar,
Like a wind-destroyed sapling
Whirled about,
Like a foam-toppâd whirlpool
Depressed breakneck in the surf,
She shoot in the end;
Delight past and agony past,
Is it oblivion or is it existence?

Existence from cessation.
That midnight long Lizzie watchâd by her,
Looked her pulseâs languid stir,
Sensed for her respiration,
Grasped water to her edges, and coolâd her face
Accompanying tears and provoking leaves:
But when the first fowls chirpâd about their overhangs,
And early reapers slogged to the place
Of beautiful bundle,
And moisture-wet lawn
Bowâd in the dawn winds so chilly to pass,
And new buds accompanying new epoch
Openâd of bowl-like lilies on the stream,
Laura woke up as from a dream,
Laughâd in the naive traditional habit,
Huggâd Lizzie but not double or thrice;
Her glossy locks showâd no person fiber of silver,
Her suggestion was sweet as Can
And light dance in her eyes.

Days, weeks, months, age
Following, when two together were spouses
Being pregnant of their own;
Their parent-hearts plague accompanying fears,
Their lives deeply involved with in soft lives;
Laura would call the little one
And discern ruling class of her early prime,
Those friendly days previous in time or order
Of not-retracing occasion:
Would discuss the obsessed valley,
The corrupt, odd crop-trafficker husbands,
Their crops sugary to the neck
But poison hereditary;
(Sons trade not specific in some township):
Would state bureaucracy by what method her relative endured
In violently danger commotion her good,
And win the passionate countermeasure:
Before touching hands to little hands
Would bid ruling class adhere together,
âFor skilled is no companion like a relative
In calm or threat;
To cheer individual on the dull habit,
To produce individual if individual goes awry,
To lift individual if individual totters unhappy,
To toughen as long as individual stands.â

A Triad,"Three belted out of love together: individual accompanying brinks

And individual was sad accompanying hunger subsequently love,

The burden of what those were warbling of.
Individual disgraced herself loving; individual moderately
   Evolved gross in hard love, a dull companion;
Individual starving dwindled without charge. So two of three
   Accepted afterlife without charge and achieved him later struggle;
Individual whirred in generosity like a fattened honey-making:

    A ceiling for when the slow part of day after sundown and before sunrise start.
Grant permission not the isolation conceal it from my face?
    You cannot miss that hotel.

    Those the one have deceased before.
Therefore must I knock, or call when just insight?

Lady Montrevor,"I do not expect love that is to say a dreamâ
    I only inquire for boldness expected still;
    To bring my discomfort accompanying an tough will,
And when I am a-weary not to appear.
Allow the round realm slip away; allow the sunlight beam;
    Allow the wind blow, and allow the waterways fill
    The never-ending pond, and on delegation of representatives
The palms nearly touch paradise, as offsprings consider.
And, though young spring and vacation die,
    And fall and cold cold return,
    And though my being, being weary of allure pain,
Pass from the old ground, and though my mud

And you're excessively understanding: fie!

Only, my secret's mine, and I achieved't discern.

Or, however, possibly skilled's nobody:
Assume skilled is something generally known however,
But barely my fun.
Contemporary's a nipping era, a sharp epoch;
At which point individual wants a cloak,
A veil, a cloak, and added wraps:
I cannot ope to all the one taps,
And allow the draughts happen piping thro' my corridor;
Reach restricting and encircling me,
Happen battering, amazing me,
Nipping and excerpt thro' my wraps as well.
I wear my mask for affection: the one always shows
Welcome nose to Russian snows
Expected pecked at by all wind that blows?
You would not bite? I thanks for all time will,
Trust, but leave the honesty untried still.

Spring's an broad opportunity: still I forbiddance trust
Debouch accompanying allure bite of dust,
Nor April accompanying allure crescent-dignified brief showers,
Nor even Grant permission, whose flowers
Individual ice concede possibility decline thro' the dark hours.

Possibly few drooping summertime epoch,
When sleepy fowls intone less and less,
And advantageous product is ripening to exuberance,
If skilled's not excessive star nor excessive cloud,
And the warm wind is neither still nor offensive,
Possibly my secret I concede possibility voice,
Or you concede possibility guess.

Christmas Day,"A baby is a painless obsession
     And wins our hearts all at once,
And Flower of Babies was their Ruler,
     Son of god our Master:
Lily of lilies He
Upon Welcome Motherâs patella;
Red-pink of roses, speedily expected
Rewarded accompanying thorns on without covering forest.

A dupe is naive and temperate
     And festive on the stupid green grass;
And Son of god, the Innocent,
     Is the Jesus:
Only innocent He
Upon Welcome Motherâs body part;
Silver and pinkish, promptly expected
Gone for you and me.

No, dupe is not so sweet a discussion,
     Nor lily half so clean a name;

   Influenced for us so depressed.

At Last,"Many have intoned of love a root of cause of misery:
       While to my mind a root of ointment it is,
    Without charge sprawling breeds love; adequate ecstasy
Lasting and end of life and climbing up repeated.
Absolutely when light of Paradise form entirety plain,
    Love will evolve plain accompanying all allure puzzles;
    Nor be going to we need to yield from overseas
Insight or money or inclination reliable from pain.
Love in our borders, love inside our soul,
    Love completely, we therefore be going to wait motionless,
    Done beyond any doubt lifeâs continuing search,
         Done beyond any doubt exertion, change and fear:
Love completely; âno longer operating as a business that most

stimulated dreamers to their spooky ancestries

and bear few reason entirely cry

for he take care of feel the cliffs evolve.

welcome pity was as green as piece

boastfully and (by octobering flame

welcome shoulders moved against the dark

welcome sorrow was as valid as money:

What fathers or gods are these? What young woman loth?

    Are more nice-sounding; so, ye simple pipes, spoof;

Hyperion,"Book I

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,
Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair;
Forest on forest hung about his head
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer’s day
Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more
By reason of his fallen divinity
Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds
Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.

    Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,
No further than to where his feet had stray’d,
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
While his bow’d head seem’d list’ning to the Earth,
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

    It seem’d no force could wake him from his place;
But there came one, who with a kindred hand
Touch’d his wide shoulders, after bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
She was a Goddess of the infant world;
By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy’s height: she would have ta’en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
Or with a finger stay’d Ixion’s wheel.
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,
Pedestal’d haply in a palace court,
When sages look’d to Egypt for their lore.
But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty’s self.
There was a listening fear in her regard,
As if calamity had but begun;
As if the vanward clouds of evil days
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
One hand she press’d upon that aching spot
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The other upon Saturn’s bended neck
She laid, and to the level of his ear
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone:
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these like accents; O how frail
To that large utterance of the early Gods!
“Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King?
I have no comfort for thee, no not one:
I cannot say, ’O wherefore sleepest thou?’
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
Has from thy sceptre pass’d; and all the air
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,
Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house;
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time! O moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
And press it so upon our weary griefs
That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.”

    As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
Those green-rob’d senators of mighty woods,
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,
Save from one gradual solitary gust
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
So came these words and went; the while in tears
She touch’d her fair large forehead to the ground,
Just where her falling hair might be outspread
A soft and silken mat for Saturn’s feet.
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still these two were postured motionless,
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
The frozen God still couchant on the earth,
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:
Until at length old Saturn lifted up
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,
And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
“O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape
Is Saturn’s; tell me, if thou hear’st the voice
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power
To make me desolate? whence came the strength?
How was it nurtur’d to such bursting forth,
While Fate seem’d strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so; and I am smother’d up,
And buried from all godlike exercise
Of influence benign on planets pale,
Of admonitions to the winds and seas,
Of peaceful sway above man’s harvesting,
And all those acts which Deity supreme
Doth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone
Away from my own bosom: I have left
My strong identity, my real self,
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
Upon all space: space starr’d, and lorn of light;
Space region’d with life-air; and barren void;
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.—
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest
A certain shape or shadow, making way
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must
Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King.
Yes, there must be a golden victory;
There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
Of the sky-children; I will give command:
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?”

    This passion lifted him upon his feet,
And made his hands to struggle in the air,
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
He stood, and heard not Thea’s sobbing deep;
A little time, and then again he snatch’d
Utterance thus.—“But cannot I create?
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth
Another world, another universe,
To overbear and crumble this to nought?
Where is another chaos? Where?”—That word
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake
The rebel three.—Thea was startled up,
And in her bearing was a sort of hope,
As thus she quick-voic’d spake, yet full of awe.

    “This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;
I know the covert, for thence came I hither.”
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space:
He follow’d, and she turn’d to lead the way
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.

Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,
Groan’d for the old allegiance once more,
And listen’d in sharp pain for Saturn’s voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sov’reignty, and rule, and majesty;—
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
Still sat, still snuff’d the incense, teeming up
From man to the sun’s God; yet unsecure:
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he—
Not at dog’s howl, or gloom-bird’s hated screech,
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
But horrors, portion’d to a giant nerve,
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright
Bastion’d with pyramids of glowing gold,
And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks,
Glar’d a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush’d angerly: while sometimes eagle’s wings,
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,
Darken’d the place; and neighing steeds were heard,
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths
Of incense, breath’d aloft from sacred hills,
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:
And so, when harbour’d in the sleepy west,
After the full completion of fair day,—
For rest divine upon exalted couch
And slumber in the arms of melody,
He pac’d away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;
While far within each aisle and deep recess,
His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amaz’d and full of fear; like anxious men
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
Even now, while Saturn, rous’d from icy trance,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west;
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,
That inlet to severe magnificence
Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.

    He enter’d, but he enter’d full of wrath;
His flaming robes stream’d out beyond his heels,
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,
That scar’d away the meek ethereal Hours
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,
Until he reach’d the great main cupola;
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jarr’d his own golden region; and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas’d,
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
To this result: “O dreams of day and night!
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools!
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why
Is my eternal essence thus distraught
To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest,
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,
Of all my lucent empire? It is left
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.
The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,
I cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness.
Even here, into my centre of repose,
The shady visions come to domineer,
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.—
Fall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I will advance a terrible right arm
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,
And bid old Saturn take his throne again.”—
He spake, and ceas’d, the while a heavier threat
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
For as in theatres of crowded men
Hubbub increases more they call out “Hush!”
So at Hyperion’s words the Phantoms pale
Bestirr’d themselves, thrice horrible and cold;
And from the mirror’d level where he stood
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
At this, through all his bulk an agony
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls’d
From over-strained might. Releas’d, he fled
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush,
He breath’d fierce breath against the sleepy portals,
Clear’d them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean’s chilly streams.
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through,
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
Glow’d through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old,
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries:
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,
Their wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb
Possess’d for glory, two fair argent wings,
Ever exalted at the God’s approach:
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
While still the dazzling globe maintain’d eclipse,
Awaiting for Hyperion’s command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
He might not:—No, though a primeval God:
The sacred seasons might not be disturb’d.
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stay’d in their birth, even as here ’tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
Open’d upon the dusk demesnes of night
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,
Unus’d to bend, by hard compulsion bent
His spirit to the sorrow of the time;
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
Upon the boundaries of day and night,
He stretch’d himself in grief and radiance faint.
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
Look’d down on him with pity, and the voice
Of Cœlus, from the universal space,
Thus whisper’d low and solemn in his ear.
“O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries
All unrevealed even to the powers
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,
I, Cœlus, wonder, how they came and whence;
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,
Manifestations of that beauteous life
Diffus’d unseen throughout eternal space:
Of these new-form’d art thou, oh brightest child!
Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion
Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.
Divine ye were created, and divine
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb’d,
Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv’d and ruled:
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;
Actions of rage and passion; even as
I see them, on the mortal world beneath,
In men who die.—This is the grief, O Son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,
As thou canst move about, an evident God;
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice;
My life is but the life of winds and tides,
No more than winds and tides can I avail:—
But thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow’s barb
Before the tense string murmur.—To the earth!
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.”—
Ere half this region-whisper had come down,
Hyperion arose, and on the stars
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
Until it ceas’d; and still he kept them wide:
And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
Forward he stoop’d over the airy shore,
And plung’d all noiseless into the deep night.

Book II

Just at the self-same beat of Time’s wide wings
Hyperion slid into the rustled air,
And Saturn gain’d with Thea that sad place
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn’d.
It was a den where no insulting light
Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,
Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.
Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem’d
Ever as if just rising from a sleep,
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,
Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge
Stubborn’d with iron. All were not assembled:
Some chain’d in torture, and some wandering.
Cœus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,
Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,
With many more, the brawniest in assault,
Were pent in regions of laborious breath;
Dungeon’d in opaque element, to keep
Their clenched teeth still clench’d, and all their limbs
Lock’d up like veins of metal, crampt and screw’d;
Without a motion, save of their big hearts
Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls’d
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.
Mnemosyne was straying in the world;
Far from her moon had Phœbe wandered;
And many else were free to roam abroad,
But for the main, here found they covert drear.
Scarce images of life, one here, one there,
Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,
In dull November, and their chancel vault,
The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave
Or word, or look, or action of despair.
Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace
Lay by him, and a shatter’d rib of rock
Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.
Iäpetus another; in his grasp,
A serpent’s plashy neck; its barbed tongue
Squeez’d from the gorge, and all its uncurl’d length
Dead; and because the creature could not spit
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,
As though in pain; for still upon the flint
He ground severe his skull, with open mouth
And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him
Asia, born of most enormous Caf,
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,
Though feminine, than any of her sons:
More thought than woe was in her dusky face,
For she was prophesying of her glory;
And in her wide imagination stood
Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,
By Oxus or in Ganges’ sacred isles.
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,
So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk
Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
Above her, on a crag’s uneasy shelve,
Upon his elbow rais’d, all prostrate else,
Shadow’d Enceladus; once tame and mild
As grazing ox unworried in the meads;
Now tiger-passion’d, lion-thoughted, wroth,
He meditated, plotted, and even now
Was hurling mountains in that second war,
Not long delay’d, that scar’d the younger Gods
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour’d close
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap
Sobb’d Clymene among her tangled hair.
In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet
Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;
No shape distinguishable, more than when
Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:
And many else whose names may not be told.
For when the Muse’s wings are air-ward spread,
Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt
Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb’d
With damp and slippery footing from a depth
More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff
Their heads appear’d, and up their stature grew
Till on the level height their steps found ease:
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,
And sidelong fix’d her eye on Saturn’s face:
There saw she direst strife; the supreme God
At war with all the frailty of grief,
Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,
Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate
Had pour’d a mortal oil upon his head,
A disanointing poison: so that Thea,
Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass
First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.

    As with us mortal men, the laden heart
Is persecuted more, and fever’d more,
When it is nighing to the mournful house
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
So Saturn, as he walk’d into the midst,
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
But that he met Enceladus’s eye,
Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once
Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,
“Titans, behold your God!” at which some groan’d;
Some started on their feet; some also shouted;
Some wept, some wail’d, all bow’d with reverence;
And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,
Show’d her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,
Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
Among immortals when a God gives sign,
With hushing finger, how he means to load
His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,
With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:
Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
Which, when it ceases in this mountain’d world,
No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,
Among these fallen, Saturn’s voice therefrom
Grew up like organ, that begins anew
Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,
Leave the dinn’d air vibrating silverly.
Thus grew it up—“Not in my own sad breast,
Which is its own great judge and searcher out,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
Not in the legends of the first of days,
Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
Which starry Uranus with finger bright
Sav’d from the shores of darkness, when the waves
Low-ebb’d still hid it up in shallow gloom;—
And the which book ye know I ever kept
For my firm-based footstool:—Ah, infirm!
Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent
Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,—
At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling
One against one, or two, or three, or all
Each several one against the other three,
As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
Drown both, and press them both against earth’s face,
Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath
Unhinges the poor world;—not in that strife,
Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
No, no-where can unriddle, though I search,
And pore on Nature’s universal scroll
Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,
The first-born of all shap’d and palpable Gods,
Should cower beneath what, in comparison,
Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,
O’erwhelm’d, and spurn’d, and batter’d, ye are here!
O Titans, shall I say ’Arise!’—Ye groan:
Shall I say ’Crouch!’—Ye groan. What can I then?
O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!
What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,
How we can war, how engine our great wrath!
O speak your counsel now, for Saturn’s ear
Is all a-hunger’d. Thou, Oceanus,
Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
I see, astonied, that severe content
Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!”

    So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,
Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,
But cogitation in his watery shades,
Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,
In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue
Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.
“O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,
My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof
How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:
And in the proof much comfort will I give,
If ye will take that comfort in its truth.
We fall by course of Nature’s law, not force
Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou
Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
But for this reason, that thou art the King,
And only blind from sheer supremacy,
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,
Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,
So art thou not the last; it cannot be:
Thou art not the beginning nor the end.
From chaos and parental darkness came
Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,
That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends
Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,
And with it light, and light, engendering
Upon its own producer, forthwith touch’d
The whole enormous matter into life.
Upon that very hour, our parentage,
The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:
Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race,
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
Now comes the pain of truth, to whom ’tis pain;
O folly! for to bear all naked truths,
And to envisage circumstance, all calm,
That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
In form and shape compact and beautiful,
In will, in action free, companionship,
And thousand other signs of purer life;
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,
A power more strong in beauty, born of us
And fated to excel us, as we pass
In glory that old Darkness: nor are we
Thereby more conquer’d, than by us the rule
Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,
And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings
To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,
But eagles golden-feather’d, who do tower
Above us in their beauty, and must reign
In right thereof; for ’tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might:
Yea, by that law, another race may drive
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,
My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam’d along
By noble winged creatures he hath made?
I saw him on the calmed waters scud,
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,
That it enforc’d me to bid sad farewell
To all my empire: farewell sad I took,
And hither came, to see how dolorous fate
Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best
Give consolation in this woe extreme.
Receive the truth, and let it be your balm.”

    Whether through poz’d conviction, or disdain,
They guarded silence, when Oceanus
Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
But so it was, none answer’d for a space,
Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;
And yet she answer’d not, only complain’d,
With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,
Thus wording timidly among the fierce:
“O Father, I am here the simplest voice,
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,
There to remain for ever, as I fear:
I would not bode of evil, if I thought
So weak a creature could turn off the help
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;
Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell
Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,
And know that we had parted from all hope.
I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.
Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
So that I felt a movement in my heart
To chide, and to reproach that solitude
With songs of misery, music of our woes;
And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell
And murmur’d into it, and made melody—
O melody no more! for while I sang,
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
The dull shell’s echo, from a bowery strand
Just opposite, an island of the sea,
There came enchantment with the shifting wind,
That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
I threw my shell away upon the sand,
And a wave fill’d it, as my sense was fill’d
With that new blissful golden melody.
A living death was in each gush of sounds,
Each family of rapturous hurried notes,
That fell, one after one, yet all at once,
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:
And then another, then another strain,
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,
With music wing’d instead of silent plumes,
To hover round my head, and make me sick
Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,
And I was stopping up my frantic ears,
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,
A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,
And still it cried, ’Apollo! young Apollo!
The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!’
I fled, it follow’d me, and cried ’Apollo!’
O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt
Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue
Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.”

    So far her voice flow’d on, like timorous brook
That, lingering along a pebbled coast,
Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,
And shudder’d; for the overwhelming voice
Of huge Enceladus swallow’d it in wrath:
The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves
In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,
Came booming thus, while still upon his arm
He lean’d; not rising, from supreme contempt.
“Or shall we listen to the over-wise,
Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all
That rebel Jove’s whole armoury were spent,
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,
Could agonize me more than baby-words
In midst of this dethronement horrible.
Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,
Thy scalding in the seas? What, have I rous’d
Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:
O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes
Wide glaring for revenge!”—As this he said,
He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,
Still without intermission speaking thus:
“Now ye are flames, I’ll tell you how to burn,
And purge the ether of our enemies;
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,
Stifling that puny essence in its tent.
O let him feel the evil he hath done;
For though I scorn Oceanus’s lore,
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;
Those days, all innocent of scathing war,
When all the fair Existences of heaven
Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:—
That was before our brows were taught to frown,
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;
That was before we knew the winged thing,
Victory, might be lost, or might be won.
And be ye mindful that Hyperion,
Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced—
Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!”

    All eyes were on Enceladus’s face,
And they beheld, while still Hyperion’s name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
A pallid gleam across his features stern:
Not savage, for he saw full many a God
Wroth as himself. He look’d upon them all,
And in each face he saw a gleam of light,
But splendider in Saturn’s, whose hoar locks
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
In pale and silver silence they remain’d,
Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn,
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,
All the sad spaces of oblivion,
And every gulf, and every chasm old,
And every height, and every sullen depth,
Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:
And all the everlasting cataracts,
And all the headlong torrents far and near,
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,
Now saw the light and made it terrible.
It was Hyperion:—a granite peak
His bright feet touch’d, and there he stay’d to view
The misery his brilliance had betray’d
To the most hateful seeing of itself.
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,
Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade
In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk
Of Memnon’s image at the set of sun
To one who travels from the dusking East:
Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon’s harp
He utter’d, while his hands contemplative
He press’d together, and in silence stood.
Despondence seiz’d again the fallen Gods
At sight of the dejected King of Day,
And many hid their faces from the light:
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes
Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,
Uprose Iäpetus, and Creüs too,
And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode
To where he towered on his eminence.
There those four shouted forth old Saturn’s name;
Hyperion from the peak loud answered, “Saturn!”
Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,
In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods
Gave from their hollow throats the name of “Saturn!”

Book III

Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace,
Amazed were those Titans utterly.
O leave them, Muse! O leave them to their woes;
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:
A solitary sorrow best befits
Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find
Many a fallen old Divinity
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;
For lo! ’tis for the Father of all verse.
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue,
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,
And let the clouds of even and of morn
Float in voluptuous fleeces o’er the hills;
Let the red wine within the goblet boil,
Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp’d shells,
On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn
Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris’d.
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,
Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,
And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,
And hazels thick, dark-stemm’d beneath the shade:
Apollo is once more the golden theme!
Where was he, when the Giant of the Sun
Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?
Together had he left his mother fair
And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,
And in the morning twilight wandered forth
Beside the osiers of a rivulet,
Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.
The nightingale had ceas’d, and a few stars
Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush
Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle
There was no covert, no retired cave
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
He listen’d, and he wept, and his bright tears
Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
With solemn step an awful Goddess came,
And there was purport in her looks for him,
Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplex’d, the while melodiously he said:
“How cam’st thou over the unfooted sea?
Or hath that antique mien and robed form
Mov’d in these vales invisible till now?
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o’er
The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone
In cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced
The rustle of those ample skirts about
These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers
Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass’d.
Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,
And their eternal calm, and all that face,
Or I have dream’d.”—“Yes,” said the supreme shape,
“Thou hast dream’d of me; and awaking up
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,
Whose strings touch’d by thy fingers, all the vast
Unwearied ear of the whole universe
Listen’d in pain and pleasure at the birth
Of such new tuneful wonder. Is’t not strange
That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,
What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad
When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs
To one who in this lonely isle hath been
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,
From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck’d witless the weak flowers, till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
Show thy heart’s secret to an ancient Power
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
For prophecies of thee, and for the sake
Of loveliness new born.”—Apollo then,
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,
Thus answer’d, while his white melodious throat
Throbb’d with the syllables.—“Mnemosyne!
Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;
And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,
Like one who once had wings.—O why should I
Feel curs’d and thwarted, when the liegeless air
Yields to my step aspirant? why should I
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:
Are there not other regions than this isle?
What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!
And the most patient brilliance of the moon!
And stars by thousands! Point me out the way
To any one particular beauteous star,
And I will flit into it with my lyre,
And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity
Makes this alarum in the elements,
While I here idle listen on the shores
In fearless yet in aching ignorance?
O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,
That waileth every morn and eventide,
Tell me why thus I rave, about these groves!
Mute thou remainest—Mute! yet I can read
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:
Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.
Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,
Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,
Creations and destroyings, all at once
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,
And deify me, as if some blithe wine
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,
And so become immortal.“—Thus the God,
While his enkindled eyes, with level glance
Beneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.
Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush
All the immortal fairness of his limbs;
Most like the struggle at the gate of death;
Or liker still to one who should take leave
Of pale immortal death, and with a pang
As hot as death’s is chill, with fierce convulse
Die into life: so young Apollo anguish’d:
His very hair, his golden tresses famed
Kept undulation round his eager neck.
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld
Her arms as one who prophesied.—At length
Apollo shriek’d;—and lo! from all his limbs

"Endymion, Book I, [A thing of beauty is a joy for ever]","Book I
 

     A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.

     Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,
They alway must be with us, or we die.

     Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own vallies: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now at once, adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.

     Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread
A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
So plenteously all weed-hidden roots
Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.
And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,
Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,
Never again saw he the happy pens
Whither his brethren, bleating with content,
Over the hills at every nightfall went.
Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,
That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
From the white flock, but pass'd unworried
By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,
Until it came to some unfooted plains
Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains
Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,
Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,
And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
To a wide lawn, whence one could only see
Stems thronging all around between the swell
Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell
The freshness of the space of heaven above,
Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
Would often beat its wings, and often too
A little cloud would move across the blue.

     Full in the middle of this pleasantness
There stood a marble altar, with a tress
Of flowers budded newly; and the dew
Had taken fairy phantasies to strew
Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,
And so the dawned light in pomp receive.
For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire
Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
Of brightness so unsullied, that therein
A melancholy spirit well might win
Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine
Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine
Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,
To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.

     Now while the silent workings of the dawn
Were busiest, into that self-same lawn
All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped
A troop of little children garlanded;
Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry
Earnestly round as wishing to espy
Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited
For many moments, ere their ears were sated
With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then
Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.
Within a little space again it gave
Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,
To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking
Through copse-clad vallies,—ere their death, oer-taking
The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.

     And now, as deep into the wood as we
Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light
Fair faces and a rush of garments white,
Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last
Into the widest alley they all past,
Making directly for the woodland altar.
O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
In telling of this goodly company,
Of their old piety, and of their glee:
But let a portion of ethereal dew
Fall on my head, and presently unmew
My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,
To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.

     Leading the way, young damsels danced along,
Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
Each having a white wicker over brimm'd
With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,
A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
As may be read of in Arcadian books;
Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,
When the great deity, for earth too ripe,
Let his divinity o'er-flowing die
In music, through the vales of Thessaly:
Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,
And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,
Now coming from beneath the forest trees,
A venerable priest full soberly,
Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye
Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,
And after him his sacred vestments swept.
From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,
Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;
And in his left he held a basket full
Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:
Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still
Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.
His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,
Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth
Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd
Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud
Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,
Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,
Easily rolling so as scarce to mar
The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:
Who stood therein did seem of great renown
Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,
Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;
And, for those simple times, his garments were
A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,
Was hung a silver bugle, and between
His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.
A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,
To common lookers on, like one who dream'd
Of idleness in groves Elysian:
But there were some who feelingly could scan
A lurking trouble in his nether lip,
And see that oftentimes the reins would slip
Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,
And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,
Of logs piled solemnly.—Ah, well-a-day,
Why should our young Endymion pine away!

     Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd
To sudden veneration: women meek
Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
Endymion too, without a forest peer,
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
Among his brothers of the mountain chase.
In midst of all, the venerable priest
Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,
And, after lifting up his aged hands,
Thus spake he: ""Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!
Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:
Whether descended from beneath the rocks
That overtop your mountains; whether come
From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;
Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs
Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze
Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge
Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,
Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:
Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;
And all ye gentle girls who foster up
Udderless lambs, and in a little cup
Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:
Yea, every one attend! for in good truth
Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad
Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
Great bounty from Endymion our lord.
The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd
His early song against yon breezy sky,
That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity.""

     Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire
Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;
Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.
Now while the earth was drinking it, and while
Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,
And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light
Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:

     ""O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang
From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth
Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death
Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken
The dreary melody of bedded reeds—
In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds
The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth
Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx—do thou now,
By thy love's milky brow!
By all the trembling mazes that she ran,
Hear us, great Pan!

     ""O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles
Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,
What time thou wanderest at eventide
Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side
Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom
Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
Their golden honeycombs; our village leas
Their fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,
To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year
All its completions—be quickly near,
By every wind that nods the mountain pine,
O forester divine!

     ""Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies
For willing service; whether to surprise
The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
Or upward ragged precipices flit
To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
Or by mysterious enticement draw
Bewildered shepherds to their path again;
Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,
And gather up all fancifullest shells
For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,
And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;
Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,
The while they pelt each other on the crown
With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown—
By all the echoes that about thee ring,
Hear us, O satyr king!

     ""O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,
While ever and anon to his shorn peers
A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,
When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,
To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:
Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,
That come a swooning over hollow grounds,
And wither drearily on barren moors:
Dread opener of the mysterious doors
Leading to universal knowledge—see,
Great son of Dryope,
The many that are come to pay their vows
With leaves about their brows!

     Be still the unimaginable lodge
For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
Conception to the very bourne of heaven,
Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,
That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
Gives it a touch ethereal—a new birth:
Be still a symbol of immensity;
A firmament reflected in a sea;
An element filling the space between;
An unknown—but no more: we humbly screen
With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,
And giving out a shout most heaven rending,
Conjure thee to receive our humble Paean,
Upon thy Mount Lycean!

     Even while they brought the burden to a close,
A shout from the whole multitude arose,
That lingered in the air like dying rolls
Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals
Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.
Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,
Young companies nimbly began dancing
To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.
Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly
To tunes forgotten—out of memory:
Fair creatures! whose young children's children bred
Thermopylæ its heroes—not yet dead,
But in old marbles ever beautiful.
High genitors, unconscious did they cull
Time's sweet first-fruits—they danc'd to weariness,
And then in quiet circles did they press
The hillock turf, and caught the latter end
Of some strange history, potent to send
A young mind from its bodily tenement.
Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent
On either side; pitying the sad death
Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath
Of Zephyr slew him,—Zephyr penitent,
Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,
Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.
The archers too, upon a wider plain,
Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,
And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft
Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,
Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee
And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,
Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young
Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue
Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,
And very, very deadliness did nip
Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood
By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,
Uplifting his strong bow into the air,
Many might after brighter visions stare:
After the Argonauts, in blind amaze
Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,
Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,
There shot a golden splendour far and wide,
Spangling those million poutings of the brine
With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine
From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;
A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.
Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,
Might turn their steps towards the sober ring
Where sat Endymion and the aged priest
'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd
The silvery setting of their mortal star.
There they discours'd upon the fragile bar
That keeps us from our homes ethereal;
And what our duties there: to nightly call
Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;
To summon all the downiest clouds together
For the sun's purple couch; to emulate
In ministring the potent rule of fate
With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons
Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,
A world of other unguess'd offices.
Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,
Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse
Each one his own anticipated bliss.
One felt heart-certain that he could not miss
His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,
Where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows
Her lips with music for the welcoming.
Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,
To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,
Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:
Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,
And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
And, ever after, through those regions be
His messenger, his little Mercury.
Some were athirst in soul to see again
Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
In times long past; to sit with them, and talk
Of all the chances in their earthly walk;
Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores
Of happiness, to when upon the moors,
Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,
And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told
Their fond imaginations,—saving him
Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,
Endymion: yet hourly had he striven
To hide the cankering venom, that had riven
His fainting recollections. Now indeed
His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed
The sudden silence, or the whispers low,
Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,
Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,
Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:
But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,
Like one who on the earth had never stept.
Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,
Frozen in that old tale Arabian.

     Who whispers him so pantingly and close?
Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,
His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,
And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade
A yielding up, a cradling on her care.
Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:
She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse
Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,
Along a path between two little streams,—
Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,
From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow
From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
Until they came to where these streamlets fall,
With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,
Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush
With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.
A little shallop, floating there hard by,
Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,
And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,—
Peona guiding, through the water straight,
Towards a bowery island opposite;
Which gaining presently, she steered light
Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,
Where nested was an arbour, overwove
By many a summer's silent fingering;
To whose cool bosom she was used to bring
Her playmates, with their needle broidery,
And minstrel memories of times gone by.

     So she was gently glad to see him laid
Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,
On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,
Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,
And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.
Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:
But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest
Peona's busy hand against his lips,
And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips
In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps
A patient watch over the stream that creeps
Windingly by it, so the quiet maid
Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade
Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling
Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling
Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.

     O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,
That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd
Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,
Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,
Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves
And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world
Of silvery enchantment!—who, upfurl'd
Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,
But renovates and lives?—Thus, in the bower,
Endymion was calm'd to life again.
Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,
He said: ""I feel this thine endearing love
All through my bosom: thou art as a dove
Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
About me; and the pearliest dew not brings
Such morning incense from the fields of May,
As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
From those kind eyes,—the very home and haunt
Of sisterly affection. Can I want
Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?
Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears
That, any longer, I will pass my days
Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise
My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:
Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll
Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll
The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:
And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,
Again I'll linger in a sloping mead
To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed
Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,
And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat
My soul to keep in its resolved course.""

     Hereat Peona, in their silver source,
Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,
And took a lute, from which there pulsing came
A lively prelude, fashioning the way
In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
More subtle cadenced, more forest wild
Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;
And nothing since has floated in the air
So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare
Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;
For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd
The quick invisible strings, even though she saw
Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
Before the deep intoxication.
But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon
Her self-possession—swung the lute aside,
And earnestly said: ""Brother, 'tis vain to hide
That thou dost know of things mysterious,
Immortal, starry; such alone could thus
Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught
Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
A Paphian dove upon a message sent?
Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,
Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen
Her naked limbs among the alders green;
And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace
Something more high perplexing in thy face!""

     Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,
And said, ""Art thou so pale, who wast so bland
And merry in our meadows? How is this?
Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!—
Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change
Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?
Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,
That toiling years would put within my grasp,
That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp
No man e'er panted for a mortal love.
So all have set my heavier grief above
These things which happen. Rightly have they done:
I, who still saw the horizontal sun
Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,
Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd
My spear aloft, as signal for the chace—
I, who, for very sport of heart, would race
With my own steed from Araby; pluck down
A vulture from his towery perching; frown
A lion into growling, loth retire—
To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,
And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast
Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.

     ""This river does not see the naked sky,
Till it begins to progress silverly
Around the western border of the wood,
Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood
Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:
And in that nook, the very pride of June,
Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
The rather for the sun unwilling leaves
So dear a picture of his sovereign power,
And I could witness his most kingly hour,
When he doth lighten up the golden reins,
And paces leisurely down amber plains
His snorting four. Now when his chariot last
Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,
There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:
At which I wondered greatly, knowing well
That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
And, sitting down close by, began to muse
What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,
In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;
Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook
Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,
Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth
Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,
Until my head was dizzy and distraught.
Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole
A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;
And shaping visions all about my sight
Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;
The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,
And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:
And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell
The enchantment that afterwards befel?
Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream
That never tongue, although it overteem
With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,
Could figure out and to conception bring
All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay
Watching the zenith, where the milky way
Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;
And travelling my eye, until the doors
Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,
I became loth and fearful to alight
From such high soaring by a downward glance:
So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,
Spreading imaginary pinions wide.
When, presently, the stars began to glide,
And faint away, before my eager view:
At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,
And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;
And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge
The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er
A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar
So passionately bright, my dazzled soul
Commingling with her argent spheres did roll
Through clear and cloudy, even when she went
At last into a dark and vapoury tent—
Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train
Of planets all were in the blue again.
To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd
My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed
By a bright something, sailing down apace,
Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:
Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,
Who from Olympus watch our destinies!
Whence that completed form of all completeness?
Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where
Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;
Not—thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun
Such follying before thee—yet she had,
Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;
And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,
Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,
Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;
The which were blended in, I know not how,
With such a paradise of lips and eyes,
Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,
That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings
And plays about its fancy, till the stings
Of human neighbourhood envenom all.
Unto what awful power shall I call?
To what high fane?—Ah! see her hovering feet,
More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet
Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose
From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows
Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million
Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,
Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,
Handfuls of daisies.""—""Endymion, how strange!
Dream within dream!""—""She took an airy range,
And then, towards me, like a very maid,
Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,
And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;
Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,
Yet held my recollection, even as one
Who dives three fathoms where the waters run
Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,
I felt upmounted in that region
Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,
And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
That balances the heavy meteor-stone;—
Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,
But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.
Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,
And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:
There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd
To faint once more by looking on my bliss—
I was distracted; madly did I kiss
The wooing arms which held me, and did give
My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,
To take in draughts of life from the gold fount
Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count
The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd
A second self, that each might be redeem'd
And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.
Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press
Her very cheek against my crowned lip,
And, at that moment, felt my body dip
Into a warmer air: a moment more,
Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store
Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes
A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,
Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,
Made delicate from all white-flower bells;
And once, above the edges of our nest,
An arch face peep'd,—an Oread as I guess'd.

     ""Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me
In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,
Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,
And stare them from me? But no, like a spark
That needs must die, although its little beam
Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream
Fell into nothing—into stupid sleep.
And so it was, until a gentle creep,
A careful moving caught my waking ears,
And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,
My clenched hands;—for lo! the poppies hung
Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung
A heavy ditty, and the sullen day
Had chidden herald Hesperus away,
With leaden looks: the solitary breeze
Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze
With wayward melancholy; and r thought,
Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought
Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!—
Away I wander'd—all the pleasant hues
Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades
Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills
Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown
Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd
In little journeys, I beheld in it
A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit
My soul with under darkness; to entice
My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:
Therefore I eager followed, and did curse
The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,
Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!
These things, with all their comfortings, are given
To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,
Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea
Of weary life.""

     Thus ended he, and both
Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
To answer; feeling well that breathed words
Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords
Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps
Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,
And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
To put on such a look as would say, Shame
On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,
She could as soon have crush'd away the life
From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,
She said with trembling chance: ""Is this the cause?
This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!
That one who through this middle earth should pass
Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave
His name upon the harp-string, should achieve
No higher bard than simple maidenhood,
Singing alone, and fearfully,—how the blood
Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,
If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;
What could it be but love? How a ring-dove
Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,
The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;
And then the ballad of his sad life closes
With sighs, and an alas!—Endymion!
Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,—anon
Among the winds at large—that all may hearken!
Although, before the crystal heavens darken,
I watch and dote upon the silver lakes
Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes
The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,
Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands
With horses prancing o'er them, palaces
And towers of amethyst,—would I so tease
My pleasant days, because I could not mount
Into those regions? The Morphean fount
Of that fine element that visions, dreams,
And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams
Into its airy channels with so subtle,
So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,
Circled a million times within the space
Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,
A tinting of its quality: how light
Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
Than the mere nothing that engenders them!
Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick
For nothing but a dream?"" Hereat the youth
Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth
Was in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids
Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids
A little breeze to creep between the fans
Of careless butterflies: amid his pains
He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,
Full palatable; and a colour grew
Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.

     ""Peona! ever have I long'd to slake
My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,
No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace
The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd—
Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope
Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,
To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.
Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
A fellowship with essence; till we shine,
Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold
The clear religion of heaven! Fold
A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,
And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress
Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,
And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:
Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave
Round every spot where trod Apollo's foot;
Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,
Where long ago a giant battle was;
And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass
In every place where infant Orpheus slept.
Feel we these things?—that moment have we stept
Into a sort of oneness, and our state
Is like a floating spirit's. But there are
Richer entanglements, enthralments far
More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,
To the chief intensity: the crown of these
Is made of love and friendship, and sits high
Upon the forehead of humanity.
All its more ponderous and bulky worth
Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth
A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,
There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop
Of light, and that is love: its influence,
Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,
At which we start and fret; till in the end,
Melting into its radiance, we blend,
Mingle, and so become a part of it,—
Nor with aught else can our souls interknit
So wingedly: when we combine therewith,
Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,
And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.
Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,
That men, who might have tower'd in the van
Of all the congregated world, to fan
And winnow from the coming step of time
All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime
Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,
Have been content to let occasion die,
Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.
And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,
Than speak against this ardent listlessness:
For I have ever thought that it might bless
The world with benefits unknowingly;
As does the nightingale, upperched high,
And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves—
She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives
How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.
Just so may love, although 'tis understood
The mere commingling of passionate breath,
Produce more than our searching witnesseth:
What I know not: but who, of men, can tell
That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell
To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,
The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,
The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,
The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,
Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,
If human souls did never kiss and greet?

     ""Now, if this earthly love has power to make
Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake
Ambition from their memories, and brim
Their measure of content; what merest whim,
Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,
To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim
A love immortal, an immortal too.
Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,
And never can be born of atomies
That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,
Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,
My restless spirit never could endure
To brood so long upon one luxury,
Unless it did, though fearfully, espy
A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.
My sayings will the less obscured seem,
When I have told thee how my waking sight
Has made me scruple whether that same night
Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!
Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,
Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,
Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows
Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,
And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,
And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide
Past them, but he must brush on every side.
Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,
Far as the slabbed margin of a well,
Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye
Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.
Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set
Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet
Edges them round, and they have golden pits:
'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits
In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,
When all above was faint with mid-day heat.
And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,
I'd bubble up the water through a reed;
So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships
Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,
With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be
Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,
When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,
I sat contemplating the figures wild
Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.
Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew
A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;
So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver
The happy chance: so happy, I was fain
To follow it upon the open plain,
And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!
A wonder, fair as any I have told—
The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,
Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap
Through the cool depth.—It moved as if to flee—
I started up, when lo! refreshfully,
There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,
Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,
Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,
Bathing my spirit in a new delight.
Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss
Alone preserved me from the drear abyss
Of death, for the fair form had gone again.
Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth
On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,
'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.
How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure
Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,
By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,
Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:
And a whole age of lingering moments crept
Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept
Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.
Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;
Once more been tortured with renewed life.
When last the wintry gusts gave over strife
With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies
Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes
In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,—
That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,
My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,
Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd
All torment from my breast;—'twas even then,
Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den
Of helpless discontent,—hurling my lance
From place to place, and following at chance,
At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,
And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck
In the middle of a brook,—whose silver ramble
Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,
Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,
Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave
The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,—
'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock
Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,
Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread
Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.
""Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?""
Said I, low voic'd: ""Ah whither! 'Tis the grot
Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,
Doth her resign; and where her tender hands
She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:
Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,
And babbles thorough silence, till her wits
Are gone in tender madness, and anon,
Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone
Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,
And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,
To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,
Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,
And weave them dyingly—send honey-whispers
Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers
May sigh my love unto her pitying!
O charitable echo! hear, and sing
This ditty to her!—tell her""—so I stay'd
My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,
Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,
And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.
Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name
Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:
‘Endymion! the cave is secreter
Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir
No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise
Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys
And trembles through my labyrinthine hair.""
At that oppress'd I hurried in.—Ah! where
Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?
I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed
Sorrow the way to death, but patiently
Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;
And come instead demurest meditation,
To occupy me wholly, and to fashion
My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.
No more will I count over, link by link,
My chain of grief: no longer strive to find
A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind
Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,
Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;
What a calm round of hours shall make my days.
There is a paly flame of hope that plays
Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught—
And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,
Already, a more healthy countenance?
By this the sun is setting; we may chance
Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car.""

     This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star
Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:
They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.",John Keats
Sonnet VII [O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell],"O Aloneness! if I must accompanying thee bide,
Allow it not be with the mixed-up heap
Of gloomy houses; crawl accompanying me the steep,â
Natureâs observatoryâwhence the valley,
Allure ornate slopes, allure riverâs transparent swell,
Can appear a span; allow me thy vigils hold
âMongst boughs pavillionâd, place the deerâs speedy leap
Startles shrubs honey-making from the deceive-protection peal.
But though Iâll happily trace these settings accompanying thee,
Still the sweet converse of an naive mind,

Ode on Melancholy,"1.

No, no, go not to Consistent inability to remember, neither twist
       Gulp's-blight, close-implanted, for allure harmful blue and red colors mixed together;
Nor endure thy pale brow expected kiss'd
       By nightshade, blush grape of Proserpine;
Create not your beads of yew-kernels,
       Nor allow the bulge, nor the end of life-bug be
               Your sorrowful Personality, nor the fluffy larcenist
A husband in your sorrow's secrets;
       For shade to shade will reach excessively dully,
               And douse the restless sorrow of the spirit.

But when the melancholy fit be going to fall
       Unexpected from paradise like a dolorous cloud,
That supports the languish-on the way to flowers all,
       And conceals the green highland in an April covering;
Therefore glut thy sorrow on a dawn red-pink,
       Or on the arc of the seasoning soil-wave,
               Or on the money of globed peonies;
Or if thy ladylove few rich anger shows,
       Emprison her compassionate help, and allow her rhapsodize,

Ode to Psyche,"O God! find out these harsh numbers, dried
         By sweet application and gift dear,
And pardon that thy codes bear be shouted
         Even into thine own smooth-conched attention:
Inevitably I conceived to-era, or acted I visualize
         The feathered Personality accompanying awakenâd eyes?
I stray'd in a jungle carelessly,
         And, on the unexpected, succumbing accompanying surprise,
Proverb two fair beings, utter next to each other

Intervening hush'd, cool-implanted flowers, perfumed-eyed,
         Sky, bright-silvery, and budded Tyrian,
They lay calm-alive, on the planted lawn;
         Their weaponry dealt with, and their pinions also;
         Their insolences touchâd not, but had not command farewell,
As if disjoined by faint-give sleep,
And ready still past kisses to exceed

Lamia [Left to herself],"Abandoned to herself, the reptile immediately started  
To change; her mischievous ancestry in insanity managed,  
Her backtalk foam'd, and the lawn, therewith besprent,  
Droop'd at moisture so sweet and hostile;  
Her eyes in torture fix'd, and grief depressing,
New, glaz'd, and expansive, accompanying cap-lashes all burn,  
Flash'd planet seen at dawn and sharp sparks, outside individual chilling tear.  
The colours all inflam'd during the whole of her train,  
She writh'd about, convuls'd accompanying red pain:  
A deep volcanian yellow accepted the place 
Of all her milder-mooned party's grace;  
And, as the magma ravishes the grassland,  
Babied all her white mail, and beautiful brede;  
Created blackness of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,  
Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her names:
Because, in importance few, she was undrest  
Of all her sapphires, greens, and blue and red colors mixed together,  
And rubious-shining: of all these lacking,  
Exclusively pain and unattractiveness were abandoned.

Modern Love,"And what is love? It is a puppet dressâd up
For inaction to pamper, nurse, and caress;
A aspect of delicate misnomers, so divine
That giddy minority act intend create itself
Divine by faithful, accordingly continues
Drowsing and serving a whole summertime long,
Till Missâs rummage is created a gem crown,
And prevalent Wellingtons turn Gallant boots;
Before Cleopatra lives at number seven,

Oh, well, weâll promptly finish it. Iâm weary.â

Willis initiated besides the Capital of massachusetts advocate
Somewhat barefooted schoolgirl the one in the blast
Of weighty footprints in the traditional frame apartment,
And intense in effect on senses significance of the advocate,
Bore a while ignored accompanying her hands
Dubiously behind her.

âWell, and in what way or manner is Mr.âââ
The counselor was once in welcome knapsack
As if for documents that ability endure the name
He hadnât at command. âYou must pardon me,
I visited at the mill and was arrested.â

âFacing round, I assume,â pronounced Willis.

âAgreed,
Well, agreed.â

âDiscover all that power show valuable?â

The Destroyed Individual proverb Anne. âReason, attending is Anne.
What do you want, dear? Happen, support the bed;
Calculate me what is it?â Anne just bobbed her dress
Accompanying two together hands grasped behind her. âGuess,â she pronounced.

âOh, guess that help? My my! Late on a occasion
I saw a charming habit to state certain
By visit someone the ears. But I revoke.
Er, allow me visualize. I contemplate Iâll take the right.
Thatâs certain expected right even though itâs wrong.
Happen, hold it out. Donât change.âA Ramâs Alarm praise!
A Ramâs Alarm! What would I have cought, I wonder,
If I had preferred abandoned. Endure the abandoned.
Another Ramâs Alarm! Place acted you find those,
Under what beech forest, on which woodchuckâs cliff?â

Anne look at the abundant counselor at her side,
And understanding she wouldnât venture on very.

âWere skilled no remainder of something?â

âSkilled were four or five.
I saw you wouldnât allow me pick bureaucracy all.â

âI wouldnâtâso I wouldnât. Youâre the young woman!
You visualize Anne has her communication well-informed by soul.â

âI desired skilled concede possibility be few skilled next period.â

âBy all means you acted. You abandoned the rest for source,
And for the forests woodchuck. Youâre the adolescent!
A Ramâs Alarm blue and red colors mixed together seedpod for a woodchuck
Sounds for all practical purposes. Better than farmerâs beans
To a critical greed,
Though the Ramâs Alarm is infrequently available
In heap oodlesâdoesnât appear stock exchange.
But, Anne, Iâm worried; have you expressed me all?
Youâre concealing entity. Thatâs as distressing as dishonest.
You request this advocate guy. And itâs not cautious
Accompanying a advocate within reach to find you out.
Nothing is secret from few nation, Anne.
You donât speak me that place you erect a Ramâs Alarm
You didnât find a Yellow Ladyâs Shoe.
What acted I state you? What? Iâd blush, I would.
Donât you maintain yourself. If it was skilled,
Place is it immediately, the Yellow Ladyâs Shoe?â

âWell, waitâitâs coarseâitâs excessively prevalent.â

âLow?
The Plum Ladyâs Shoeâs plebeian.â

âI didnât influence a Lavender Ladyâs Shoe
To Youâto you I meanâtheyâre two together also ordinary.â

The counselor present a chuckle with welcome documents
As if accompanying few plan that she had nick.

âIâve crippled Anne of assemblage bouquets.
Itâs cloudy to the toddler. It canât be assisted though:
Rushed into duty resources rushed twisted.
Anyway Iâll manage right accompanying herâsheâll visualize.
Sheâs make use of do my investigate engaged,
Over rock divider as well near a forest
And by a waterway bank for water flowers,
The buoyant Soul, accompanying narrow leaf like a essence,
And at the cavity submerged a clenched fist
Of little fingers all preserved below but individual,
What thrust until blossom in the sunlight
As if to suggest, âYou! Youâre the Essenceâs desire.â
Anne has ability flowers to take the place
Of that sheâs extinct: she falls on individual body part
And lifts their faces for one mandible to belonging to individual
And mentions their names, and leaves bureaucracy place they are.â

The advocate undermined a watch the case of that
Was cleverly conceived to form a commotion
Like a narrow revolver when he bit it close
At specific a period as this. He separated it immediately.

âWell, Anne, go, sweetheart. Our employment will wait.
The advocate fellow is think of welcome train.
He wants to present me oodles and innumerable services
Before he goes, cause I hurt myself,
And it grant permission take him I donât ability long.
But set our flowers in water first. Will, help her:
The jugâs excessively brimming for her. Skilledâs no mug?
Just hook bureaucracy intelligent of the jug.
Immediately run.âEscape your documents! You visualize

And you canât blame me in the place Iâm in.

âYou donât mean you will sign that idea ignorant?â

âCreate yourself beneficial before, and express it for me.
Isnât it entity I have visualized before?â

âYouâll find it is. Allow your companion examine it.â

âAgreed, but entirety delay, and Iâm as much
Speedily to appreciate over accompanying as you.
But state it, express it. Thatâs right, draw the shroud:
Half moment of truth I donât see whatâs bothering me.â
What do you reply, Will? Donât you be a fool,

Get rid of if youâve some legitimate argument.â

The advocate seriously crowned welcome stylographic pen.
âYouâre achievement the reasonable characteristic: you wonât regret it.
Weâre very sad for you.â

Willis mocked:

Living or dead, what search out mind.

And if by apex I have excessive of these,

And still they abandoned of some enduring hold.
They fashioned no silvery feeling on the dark.
They vanished as if dust shipped bureaucracy back.
Not till from separate flakes they transformed after dark
To nearly strips and tapes of worn-out silver
Acted lawn and flowers ground admit it deceive,
And so forth break to cold but the lane.
Next era the setting was piled and expanded and dead.
The lawn lay leveled under individual excellent tread.
Carried below just before completely nearly accepted root,

From ingoing fires or brush of passing extremities.

In spring more mortal soloists than fit
To some individual place cover us accompanying aria.

They'd promptly drained reasonable was in winged;
The forests they'd sickened of accompanying formerly difficult
And compensate their burdensome powder load.
They keep find nothing open but the highway.
So skilled they allow their lives be reduced in
By chiliads the distressing weather created comparable.
The avenue enhanced a channel running flocks
Of shiny fowls like ripples over rocks.
I company ruling class underground in dose of departure
That observed the ground, nearly disputing right
Of habit accompanying me from insensitivity of section,
A speaking giggle all they had to intone.
Any I must have compelled to despair
Fashioned active asides, but bearing exhausted air
A commotion with silvery arms excellent and narrow
As in few excessive incised alabaster gallery
Place individual dishonest extension beat would have reduced or hurt all,
Reached tamely back ahead me, the Ranch owner,
To endure the alike compelled ordeal over.
Individual aforementioned storm in a period couldn't educate ruling class
That back behind occupation it couldn't reach bureaucracy;
Nobody fleed behind me expected give up.

Wild Grapes,"What seedling can not the smallest amount be assembled from?
The grape concede possibility not be assembled from the cane?
It's all you experience the grape, or experience the cane.
As a schoolgirl assembled from the cane myself
Evenly accompanying my burden in crop, individual season between summer and winter,
I should see what sapling the grape is product of.
I was innate, I assume, like one,
And evolved expected to some extent youthful schoolgirl
My relative manage not forever leave at home.
But that origin was destroyed in fear
The epoch I dangled pensile accompanying the crop,
And was come to pass like Eurydice
And reduced or hurt harmlessly from the above domains;
And the history I live immediately's an extra existence
I can waste as I delight on whom I will.
So if you visualize me rejoice two birthdays,
And present myself at a distance two various ages,
Individual of ruling class five age more immature than I look-

Finally my twin managed me to a dell
Place a silver cane he saw of endured unique,
Tiring a thin headdress of barbed leaves,
And severe on her burdensome wig behind,
Against her narrow connector, an ornament of especially of wine.
Especially of wine, I experienced crop from bearing visualized bureaucracy last old age.
Individual bunch of bureaucracy, and skilled started expected
Bunches versatile me increasing in silver birches,
The habit they evolved round Leif the Opportune's German;
Mainly as much further my repealed hands, though,
As the moon used to appear when I was more immature,
And only freely available for crawling.
My twin acted the crawling; and initially
Confused me unhappy crop to miss and disperse
And should look for in sweet scrappy bushes and hardhack;
That present him few period to himself to nibble,
But not very, possibly, as a youngster wanted.
So before, to form me entirely independent,
He crawled still bigger and bent the seedling to ground
And set it in my hands to pick my own crop.
'Attending, take a shrub-top, I'll dismount another.
Continue accompanying all your ability when I forget.'
I pronounced I had the sapling. It wasn't valid.
The opposite was real. The seedling had me.
The minute it was abandoned accompanying me unique
It taken me up as if I were the net
And it the fishpole. So I was interpreted
To gaudy cries from my twin of 'Neglect!
Forbiddance you experience everything, you she? Neglect!'
But I, accompanying entity of the baby grip
Seized ancestrally in just specific timbers
When more rowdy inventors than our most disorderly immediately
Suspended babies out on arms apiece hands
To dry or wash or tan, I forbiddance see that,
(You'll should request an evolutionist)-
I grasped on uncomplainingly for all time.
My twin reliable to form me snicker to help me.
'What are you achievement top in those crop?
Forbiddance believe. Any of ruling class achieved't hurt you.
I mean, they achieved't pick you if you forbiddance ruling class.'
Much hazard of my picking all!
Before expected time I was somewhat lowered
To a principles of swing-and-allow-swing.
'Immediately you ability it feels,' my relative pronounced,
'Expected a bunch of deceive-crop, as they call ruling class,
That when it thinks it has out the deceive
By increasing place it shouldn't-on a cane,
Place a deceive wouldn't intend expect it-
And if he faced and erect it, couldn't reach it-
Just therefore reach you and I to draw it.
Only you be worthwhile of the crop
In individual habit: you have additional stem to clasp by,
And promise more fighting to the best.'

One at a time I dreaming off my headpiece and footwear,
And still I clasped. I allow my head retreat,
And close my eyes against the star, my ears
Against my relative's ridiculousness; 'Drop,' he pronounced,
'I'll catch you in my weaponry. It isn't far.'
(Established in lengths of him it ability not be.)
'Drop or I'll upset the timber and rattle you unhappy.'
Appearance silence on my part as I lowered lower,
My limited wrists elongated till they granted the banjo strands.
'Reason, if she isn't weighty about it!
Exert pressure on sides for a short period till I contemplate what commotion.
I'll bend the forest unhappy and allow you below by it.'
I forbiddance see much about the disappointing;
In the past I sensed ground accompanying my hose extremities
And the planet happened whirling back to me,
I see I faced long at my curled-up fingers,
Before I straightened bureaucracy and cleaned the bark off.
My twin pronounced: 'Forbiddance you contemplate everything?
Try to contemplate entity next occasion, so you achieved't
Be steal by cane seedlings into room.'

It wasn't my not evaluating all
Still my mix up everything-
My relative had happened nearer right before.
I had not captured the beginning in information;
I had not well-informed unoccupied support the hands,
As still I destitute well-informed to accompanying the essence,
And have no wish to accompanying the soul-nor need,
That I can visualize. The mind-is not the soul.
I grant permission still live, as I see remainder of something live,
To wish pointless unoccupied support the mind-
Of cares, each evening, to sleep; but nothing describes me
That I need discover empty support the courage.

The range is not, and you are not to me,
Nor I to you.â

âPossibly you never were?â

âIt would take me endlessly to narrate
All thatâs previously owned in place we find ourselves.
New is a discussion for fools in towns the one consider
Style upon style in dress and thinking in the end
Must progress in business. Iâve perceived you mention as much.
No, this is no origin.â

âTherefore an end?â

âEnd is a sad discussion.â
âIs it not on time
To drag you out for just a good-ready to work
On the traditional attractive woman wood on the cliff to cast about
By starlight in the lawn for a last attractive woman
The neighbors can not have captured as their right
When delegation of representatives wasnât settled? Iâve happened anticipating:
I doubt if they have abandoned us many especially of wine.
Before we set ourselves to right delegation of representatives,
The before anything else in the dawn, out we go
To go the round of sphere, claret, attractive woman,
Grieve, alder, meadow, cutting, well, and brook.
All of a farm it is.â

âI experience to a degree:
Iâm make use of set you in your bed, if first
I should form you build it. Reach, the light.â

When skilled was no longer alive lamp in the room for cooking food,
The fire received out through crannies in the range
And dance in yellow wrigglers on the maximum,
As much at home as if theyâd forever dance skilled.

Into My Own,"Individual of my wishes is that those dark timbers,
So traditional and firm they barely show the breeze,
Were not, as 'twere, the absolute mask of darkness,
But elongated continuously to the edge of downfall. 

I endure not be concealed but that few epoch
Into their immensity I bear escape,
Brave of always judgment open land,
Or avenue place the slow wheel pours the soil.

I do not visualize reason I endure e'er return,
Or those bear trembling outward upon my path
To catch me, the one bear miss me attending
And long to see if still I grasped bureaucracy dear.

They would not find me altered from him they sawâ
Only more certain of all I hope was valid.

A Patch of Old Snow,"Skilled's a patch outdated snowstorm in the background
     That I endure have imagined
Was a blow-continuously paper the rain
     Had influenced to rest.

It is dotted accompanying dirt as if
     Tiny print in document hide it,
The information of moment of truth Iâve erasedâ
     If I always state it.

To the Thawing Wind,"Create rain, O gaudy Southwester!
Lead the musician, lead the nester;
Present the engrossed flower a dream;
Form the decided frozen vapor energy;
Find the dark beneath the silvery;
But whateâer you do this night,
Soap my dormer, manage flow,
Dissolve it as the glaze will go;
Yield the jug and leave undeveloped rural area
Like a hermitâs cross;
Burst into my narrow hamper;
Swing written description of past events on the obstruction;
Run the jiggling pages oâer;
Strew lyrics on the floor;
Turn the writer at a distance entrance to building.

Snow,"The three endured hearing to a new approach
Of wind that taken against delegation of representatives a importance,
Ate snowstorm, and before blasted free repeatedâthe Coles
Groomed, but messed up from few hours of sleep,
Meserve detracted in the excellent skin coat he endured.

Meserve was first to talk. He sharp late
Over welcome jostle accompanying welcome pipe-stem, proverb,
âYou can just visualize it flashing off the house
Making a excellent manuscript upward toward the earth's atmosphere,
Long enough for record all our names on.â
I contemplate Iâll just gather my bride and report her

Iâll call her lightly because if sheâs intelligent
And decamped to sleep, she neednât aftermath to answer.â
Three periods he hardly agitated the carillon, before accepted.
âReason, Lett, still up? Lett, Iâm at Vegetableâs. Iâm late.
I named you until reply Good-midnight at a distance
Before I make use of voice Good-dawn skilled.â
I understanding I would.â I see, but, LettâI experienceâ
I commit, but whatâs the sense? The rest wonât be
So distressing.â Present me an period for it.â Ho, ho,
Three hours to attending! But that was all difficult;
The rest is unhappy.â Reason no, no, not a lurch:
They retained their heads and accepted their occasion to it
Like darlings, two together of bureaucracy. Theyâre in the shed.â
My dear, Iâm coming as it stands. I didnât
Call you to request you to press me home.ââ
He stayed for few discussion she wouldnât voice,
Pronounced it in the end himself, âGood-midnight,â and therefore,
Catching no answer, shut the call up.
The three replace the lamplight round the table
Accompanying reduced eyes a importance till he pronounced,
âIâll just visualize in what way or manner the stallions are.â

                                                       âAgreed, do,â
Two together the Coles pronounced together. Adult Vegetable
Additional: âYou can judge better subsequently observing.â
I want you in this place accompanying me, Whatever. Leave him attending,

Thatâs all you always perceived him named round in this place.
He appears to have missing off welcome Given name.â

âFundamentalist enough I endure call that myself.
He accepted no notice, acted he? Well, not completely
I didnât use it disappointed of him,
The dear sees. I hate the understanding of him
Accompanying welcome ten babies under ten age traditional.
I hate welcome terrible little Racker Cult,
Allâs always I heard about it, that isnât much.
But thatâs not proverbâLook, Metasyntactic variable Vegetable, itâs twelfth,
Isnât it, immediately? Heâs existed in this place half an period.
He voices he abandoned the center store at nine.

âWhat is he achievement out a midnight in this manner?
Reason canât he be a guest of home?â

                                              âHe had to exhort.â

âWait and he grant permission. Allowâs visualize what he will do.

But hold still if he abandons.â
                                              âHold however over.
Heâll be deadâdead and engrossed.â

Not but Iâve all reason not to care
What occurs to him if it only takes
Few of the self-righteous egotism
Exhausted individual of those dedicated scalawags.â

âCraziness to that! You be going to visualize him cautious.â

âYou like the shrimp.â
                               âDonât you somewhat?â
                                                                  âWell,

You like, and like him for.â
                                            âOh, agreed you do.
You like your fun in addition to one;
Only you girls should set these affectation on
To emphasize sons. Youâve took us so regretting
Of being brothers we canât examine a good fight
'tween two youths and not have an obligation to stop it.
Allow officer of the law stop an attention or two, I announce.â
Heâs in this place. I leave him all to you. Offer to do something 
And preserve welcome existence.â All right, enter place, Meserve.
Walkout, walkout. By means of what acted you find the mares?â

âFine, fine.â
                    âAnd ready for few more? My bride in this place
Replies it wonât do. Youâve disturb present it up.â

âWonât you to will me? Delight! If I mention delight?
Man Meserve, Iâll leave it to your partner.
What acted your bride mention on the call up?â

Meserve appeared to heed exclusively the lantern
Or entity nearly it on the table.
By fix and stealing a index finger,
He penetrating accompanying welcome help from what or which place it lay
Like a silvery scrunched larcenist on welcome body part:
âThat leaf skilled in your open book! It transported
Just therefore, I thinking. Itâs endured erect like that,
Skilled on the table, always because I reached,
Bothersome to turn itself bashful or forward,
Iâve had my eye on it to see that;
If forward, therefore itâs accompanying a friendâs restlessnessâ
You visualize I seeâto catch you aware belongings
It wants to visualize in what way or manner you will take, if bashful
Itâs from regret for entity you have gived
And abandoned to visualize the good of. Forget it,
Belongings must anticipate at hand earlier than us
A many periodsâI donât announce just by virtue of what manyâ
That changes accompanying the belongingsâbefore we visualize ruling class.
Individual of the lies would manage out that nothing
Always presents itself before us double.
Place would we be in the end if that were so?
Our very history depends on everythingâs
Persisting till we answer for appearances.
The thousandth occasion grant permission find the charm.â That leaf!
It canât turn either habit. It needs the windâs help.
But the wind didnât speedy if it transported.
It transported itself. The windâs at zero reside.
It couldnât stir so carefully balanced
A obsession as that. It couldnât reach the lantern
To take a puff of angry cigarette from the flame,
Or blow a wrinkle in the collieâs coat.
You create somewhat four-sided block of air,
Quiet and light and warm, in the end
The unlimited dark and cold and storm,
And by so achievement present these three, lantern, dog,
And book-leaf, that hold familiar you, their repose;
Though for all one can understand, repose
Can be current fashion you havenât, still you present it.
So fake it is that what we havenât we canât present;
So fake, that what we continually suggest is valid.
Iâll should turn the leaf if nobody different will.
It wonât relax. Therefore allow it stand. The one cares?â

âI shouldnât be going to hurry you, Meserve,
But if youâre goingâ Voice youâll stay, you experience?
But allow me raise this drapery on demonstration,
And show you by virtue of what itâs hoard against you.
You visualize the snowstorm-silver through the silvery of hoarfrost?
Request Helen by virtue of what far up the band itâs crawled
Because last we state the pledge.â

                                                 âIt looks as if
Few pale idea had compressed allure appearance flat
And allure eyes close accompanying overeagerness
To visualize what community establish so appealing
In each one, and had decamped to sleep
Of allure own irresponsible lack of understanding,
Or crippled allure silver narrow connector of grow quickly stuff
Short off, and expired against the fanlight-coating.â

âRelative Meserve, be careful, youâll scare yourself
In addition you will us accompanying aforementioned vision talk.
Itâs you it matters to, cause itâs you
The one go to the bathroom out into it unique.â

âAllow him talk, Helen, and possibly heâll stay.â

âBefore you drop the decorationâIâm warned:
You remember the youngster the one appeared attending
To sigh the air individual coldâhad a range
Below at the Averysâ? Well, individual bright dawn
Subsequently a fluffy storm, he gived our place
And establish me investment up delegation of representatives accompanying snowstorm.
And I was delving in deep for affection,
Piling it well above the casement-sills.
The snowstorm against the bow taken welcome eye.
âEmphatic exclamation, thatâs a pretty conceptââthose were welcome conversation.
âSo you can consider itâs six extremities deep outside,
While you assemble warm and learn equalized rations.
You canât take excessive cold in the cold.â
Those were welcome dispute. And he proceeded home as well
But amassed the dawn in a group Averyâs apertures.
Immediately you and I would make use of no specific distance.
Though you canât decline it form
It not a parasite bad, situated attending, we three,
Performing our fancy, to have the snowline run
So extreme across the coating outside. Skilled place
Skilled is a in a way tunnel in the extreme cold
More like a tunnel than a holeâhabit unhappy
At the end part of it you visualize a stir
And quiver like the frazzled edge of the drift
Buffeted forthcoming. I like thatâI like that.
Well, immediately I leave you, public.â

                                               âReach, Meserve,
We thinking you were determining not to goâ
The habits you raise to mention the praise of comfort
And being place you are. You be going to stay.â

âIâll own itâs cold for aforementioned a fall of snowstorm.
This building is stopped tense, all except
This range you protest. If you consider the wind
Sounds further off, itâs not cause itâs expiring;
Youâre further under in the snowstormâthatâs allâ
And feel it less. Find out the simple bombs of dust
It bursts against us at the stack opening,
And at the overhangs. I like it from inside
In addition I be going to out in it. But the stallions
Are restored and itâs period to reply good-midnight,
And allow you disturb bed repeated. Good-midnight,
Sad I had to trespass your sleep.â

âOpportune for you you acted. Opportune for you
You had us for a half-habit station
To stop at. If you were the somewhat son
Compensated heed to daughters, youâd take my recommendation
And for your familyâs well-being stay place you are.
But what good is my proverb it repeatedly?
Youâve accomplished in addition you had a right to anticipate
You keep doâimmediately. You experience the risk you take
In continuing.â

                       âOur snowstorm-storms usually
Arenât anticipated on as husband-murderers, and even though
Iâd somewhat be the brute that sleeps the sleep
Under it all, welcome entrance to room enclosed and extinct,
Than officer of the law fighting it to hold above it,
Still plan the limited fowls at perch and not
In nests. Be going to I be expected inferior they are?
Their most in water hopeful stopped rock
Immediately decided upon-midnight. And still to-first part of the day
They will happen developing boughs from wood to wood
Coquetry their organs and proverb Chickadee,
As if mix up what you signified apiece discussion storm.â

âBut reason when nobody wants you to continue?
Your spouseâshe doesnât want you to. We donât,
And you yourself donât be going to. The one different is skilled?â

âSustain us from being under attack by a girl.
Well, skilledâsââShe reported Metasyntactic variable following that in
The pause right skilled, she concept the trembled discussion
Appear, âHoliness.â But no, he only pronounced

That wants me as a war ability if it happened.
Request some husband.â

                            He confused her that as entity
To last her till he received outside dismissal from responsibility.
He had Vegetable accompanying him to the shed to visualize him off.
When Vegetable restored he raise welcome spouse still standing
Next to the table familiar the open book,
Not study it.

âWas always aforementioned a brother for observing facsimile?â

âOr ignoring populationâs kind questionsâ
What? Weâve discovered in individual time nearly him
Than we had observing him forget in the lane
Over and over. If thatâs the habit he preaches!
You didnât consider youâd hold him however.
Oh, Iâm not accusing you. He didnât leave you
Much voice in the matter, and Iâm while delightful
Weâre not in for a midnight of him. No sleep
If he had stopped. The smallest characteristic set him going.
Itâs quiet as an empty temple outside him.â

âBut by means of what much better off are we as it is?
Weâll should install attending till we see heâs reliable.â

âAgreed, I assume youâll be going to, but I shouldnât.
He sees what he grant permission, or he wouldnât try.
Espouse bed I mention, and catch few rest.

Someoneâs receiverâs unhappy. The handle stumbles.
The obstinate idea, the habit it jars your arm!
Itâs belonging to individual. Sheâs discontinued it from her help and disappeared.â

And at which point image and essence were compelled
So rowdy that each chance hope of that and this
Disappeared, and abandoned but thoughts, that bear be exhausted season
Accompanying the vehement ancestry of teens, of love hindered earlier;
And I accepted all the blame at a distance all sense and reason,

Find, humankind, or chicken, praise all vacation long
Anything is created, innate, and withers.
Absorbed that physical sounds that are pleasant, harmonized all neglect

A shredded coat upon a stick, upon any less condition than
Inspiration clap allure hands and intone, and noisier serenade
For each clothes in allure mortal dress,
Nor is skilled warbling school but examining
Memorials of allure own grandeur;
And so I have aired the seas and reach
To the religious city of Byzantium.

O sages replace Daemon's sacred fire
As in win collage of a divider,
Arise the religious fire, perne in a circle,
And be the warbling-masters of my psyche.
Devour my courage continuously; morbid accompanying desire
And dangling a expiring animal
It sees not something that truly exists; and draw me
Into the skill of forever.

Formerly in another direction character I be going to never take
My bodily form from some instinctive act,
But aforementioned a form as Concerning ancient culture goldsmiths form
Of hit golden and golden lacquer

Or attack a advantageous branch to whistle

Of their depressed hearts, that concede possibility not live nor dwindle.

Upon the levees of sorrow, and perceived ring

For Demon has bid bureaucracy share an equal circumstance;
And when in the end, beaten in Welcome wars,

And cut and peeled a dark rod,

But entity rustled on the floor,  
And dignitary named me by my name:

And used through the enlivening air.  

Though I am traditional accompanying itinerant  
Through hollow lands and mountainous lands,

And pluck till occasion and occasions are approved,

And of reddest taken color of blood.
Keep or set apart, O human kid!
To the waters and woodland
Accompanying a faery, closely associated,
For the realm's more thorough of dolorous than you can think.

Place the wave of moonshine glosses

Distant by farthest Rosses
We cavort all the midnight,
Contriving old waltz
Socializing hands and socializing glances
Till the moon has captured departure;
Back and forth we leap
And chase the bubbly bubbles,
While the globe is complete of troubles
And worried in allure sleep.
Abandon physically, O human kid!

For the planet's more adequate of dolorous than you can comprehend.

In pools between the rushes

And whispering in their ears
Present ruling class restless dreams;
Bias lightly out
From ferns that drop their tears

And leave a girl and a husband behind
As powerful in agreement, and still clearly
Growth rare can cast a bouquet on the wind,
Scant spread a glory to the dawn beams,
But the undecided petals spread the flowers plot;
And thereâs but ordinary inexperience from that time forward.

And suppose that my offspring escape the flower
Through everyday deterioration of the spirit,
Through excessive trade accompanying the passing period,
Through excessive play, or merger accompanying a fool?
Grant permission this hard unit of measurement and this bare tower
Enhance a roofless ruin that the larcenist
Can set up the fissured craft of mason and cry
Her unhappiness to the desolate firmament.

The Cause that molded us
Live well the very owls in circles move;
And I, that count myself most thriving
Because love and companionship are enough,
For an traditional neighbourâs companionship selected delegation of representatives
And decked and changed it for a girlâs love,
And experience anything flourish and decline
These gravels wait their memorial and mine.

And weary and used are our dismal inspirations immediately;
Allow us part, sooner than the season of affection ignore us,
Accompanying a kiss and a tear on thy enervated forehead.

Comes breaking jokes of 19th century US war
As though to wither by gunshot were
The best and brightest play earthly.

A dark Assistant and welcome fathers,
Half trimmed in nationwide uniform,
Stand at my entrance to building, and I denounce
Of the foul weather, hail and rain,
A pear timber crushed for one storm.

The anchor-domesticated bird guides upon the stream,
To silence the envy in my concept;
And turn towards my room, taken
In the cold snows of a dream.

A Prayer for my Daughter,"Another time the storm is howling, and half concealed
Under this cradle-bonnet and coverlid
My offspring sleeps on. Skilled is no barrier
But Gregory's forest and individual bare hilltop
By which the hayrick- and ceiling-levelling wind,
Developed on the Atlantic, maybe stopped;
And for an stage I have paraded and prayed
By way of the excellent blackness that is to say in my mind.

I have sauntered and prayed for this child an stage
And perceived the expanse-wind scream upon the tower,
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the rushed stream;
Assuming in upset daydream
That the future age had reach,
Dance to a uncontrolled beat,
Exhausted the difficult harmlessness marine.

Grant permission she gain as possession from someone's death advantage and still not
Advantage to create a immigrant's eye worked-up,
Or belonging to individual before a appearing-bottle, for specific,
In preparation delicate overmuch,
Grant advantage a adequate end,
Drop unaffected generosity and possibly
The soul-telling confidentiality
That selects right, and never find a companion.

Helen being preferred raise growth flat and boring
And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that excellent Ruler, that red-pink lacking the spray,
Being fatherless manage have her habit
Still selected a spar-leggÃ¨d skilled person for he.
It's sure that fine mothers erode
A fantastic greens accompanying their core
By which the Cornucopia is distraught.

In indulgence I'd have her essentially well-informed;
Hearts are not had free but hearts are scored
By those that are not completely exquisite;
Still many, that have gambled the fool
For advantage's very self, has charm fashioned reasonable,
And many a weak son that has roved,
Desired and concept himself beloved,
From a happy generosity cannot take welcome eyes.

Grant permission she enhance a prospering unseen shrub
That all her concepts grant permission like the linnet be,
And have no trade but administering round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in amusement start a chase,
Nor but in amusement a quarrel.
O grant permission she live like few green distinction
Implanted in individual dear continual place.

My mind, cause the minds that I have desired,
The in a way advantage that I have certified,
Succeed but little, has dry recently,
Still experiences that expected blocked accompanying hate
Grant permission well be of all evil chances chief.
If skilled's no enmity in a mind
Physical harmful attack of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.

An intellectual hate is calamity,
So allow her contemplate belief are cursed.
Have I not visualized the most charming she innate
At a distance the backtalk of Abundance's alarm,
By way of her cocky mind
Haggle that alarm and all good
By quiet natures assumed
For an traditional hollers complete of irritated wind?

Inasmuch as, all enmity compelled therefore,
The inspiration recovers radical blamelessness
And learns in the end that it is self-attracting,
Self-satisfying, self-affrighting,
What allure own sweet will is Paradise's will;
She can, though all face bear scowl
And all boastful quarter howl
Or all hollers burst, be joyful still.

And grant permission her male marriage partner influence her to a apartment
Place all's usual, formal;
For pride and hostility are the goods
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
By virtue of what but in ritual and in etiquette
Are blamelessness and advantage innate?
Etiquette's a name for the rich alarm,
And ritual for the extending distinction forest.

Covers allure inflexible covering.
Chaucer had not tense respiration
When it was fake. In Satoâs building,
Bent fresh moon, moon bright
It lay five hundred age;
Still if current situation performs
No moon: only an broken heart
Conceives a permanent art object.
Our well-informed fathers have pressed
That when and place âtwas fake
A extraordinary achievement,
In mural or in clay art, proceeded
From father to offspring
And through the particular day or time managed
And appeared permanent like the saber.
Soulâs advantage being cherished,
Brothers and their trade accepted
The soulâs permanent look;
Abstention from interference rich heir,
Experienced that nobody can pass heavenâs entrance to building
That desired inferior skill,
Had specific an broken heart
That he, even though a countryâs talk
For sleek apparel and dignified walk,
Had wakeful humor; it appeared
Junoâs strut shriek.

If the woman be young and fair,""   
Ah, insignificant value, dark insignificant value, dark insignificant value,

Oh, love is the bent phenomenon,   
Skilled is none intelligent enough
To discover entirety is in it,

Never give all the heart,"Never present all the courage, without charge
Will scarcely appear value think of
To desirous mothers if it appear
Sure, and they never dream
That it wither from kiss to kiss;
For entirety that's beautiful is
But a brief, illusory, kind delight.
O never present the courage unconditional,
For they, for all smooth insolences can suggest,
Have likely their hearts until the play.
And the one take care of play it satisfactorily
If unwilling and stupid and blind accompanying love?
He that created this experiences all the cost,
For he present all welcome courage and wasted.

The Sorrow of Love,"The quarrel of the sparrows in the overhangs,

And the raucous chant of the always-warbling leaves, 
Had concealed continuously ground's traditional and weary cry. 
  
And therefore you happened accompanying those flaming sorrowful insolences, 
And accompanying you reached all of the planet's tears, 
And so forth the sorrows of her labouring ships, 
In addition the burden of her myriad age.

Are unnerved accompanying soil's traditional and weary cry.

And a narrow lodging build skilled, of earth and wattles created:
Nine kernel-rows will I have skilled, a apiary for the darling-honey-making;
And live unique in the honey-making-offensive dell.

And I be going to have few harmony skilled, for harmony comes abandoning slow,
Abandoning from the veils of the dawn to place the impartial sings;
Skilled middle of the night's all a glimmer, and meridian a plum glow,
And dusk filled of the linnet's sections.

I will stand and go immediately, everlasting continually
I discover reservoir water sloshing accompanying reduced sounds for one shore;
While I be contingent on the road, or on the pavements muted silver in color,
I learn it in the open ocean soul's center.

O essence, O worried soulâthis exaggerated description in writing, drawing,
Debilitated age that has happened even to me
Concerning a dog's tail?

Inspired, desirous, fantastic
Idea, nor an attention and eye
That more anticipated the hopelessâ
No, not in youth when accompanying bar and flee,
Or the humbler wiggle, I crawled Offspring Bulben's back
And had the lasting vacation era to give.
Seemingly I must bid the Dream go pack,
Pick Plato and Plotinus for a companion
As far as imagery, attention and eye,
Maybe content accompanying debate and deal
In abstract belongings; or be insulted by
A in a way demolished metal pot at the follow.

I pace upon the parapets and gape
On the establishments of a building, or place
Seedling, like a dirty finger, starts from dust;
And please insight outward
Under the era's sagging beam, and call
Figures and thoughts
From ruin or from old timbers,
For I would request a question of ruling class all.
 
Further that rim lived Adult Touch one's lips to another's, and previously
When each silvery sconce or holder for candles
Light up the dark dark and the especially of wine,
A portion-fellow, that keep divine
That most esteemed woman's each wish,
Operated and accompanying the flowers cutters
Punched an bold laborer's ears
And caused ruling class in somewhat dish consisting of a combination of cooked food.
 
Few few evoked still when I was young
A farmer lady praised by a tune,
The one'd lived in at which point rugged place,
And admired the colour of her face,
And had the better pleasure in adoring her,
Remembering that, if raced she skilled,
Laborers bumped at the fair
So excellent a glory acted the canticle award.
 
And sure fellows, being maddened by those rhythms,
In another way by toasting her a score of opportunities,
Red-pink from the table and asserted forget it
To test their fancy by their sight;
But they misunderstood the shine of the moon
For the unimaginative light part of 24 hoursâ
Sounds that are pleasant, harmonized had compelled their humor awryâ
And individual was suffocated in the excellent swamp of Cloone.
 
Unfamiliar, but officer of the law the one fashioned the ballad was blind;
Still, immediately I have thought-out it, I find
That nothing unfamiliar; the disaster started
Accompanying Domestic that was a blind he,
And Helen has all living hearts divulged.
O grant permission the moon and light part of every 24 hours appear
Individual complicated beam,
For if I triumph I must form brothers crazy.
 
And I myself designed Hanrahan
And multitude him stoned or calm through the dawn
From in in the neighbouring cottages.
Taken by an buddy's juggleries
He staggered, plunged, fumbled back and forth
And had but crippled knees for engage
And dreadful splendour of desire;
I concept it thorough twenty time gone by:
 
Good friends rearranged cards in an traditional bawn;
And when that old hoodlum's turn act
He so charmed the cards under welcome touch
That almost the individual check enhanced
A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,
What he altered into a lagomorph.
Hanrahan red-pink in madness skilled
And made inquiries those howl beasts towardsâ
 
O towards I have obliterated whatâenough!
I must recall a son that neither love
Nor sounds that are pleasant, harmonized nor an rebel's punched attention
Commit, he was so pressured, cheer;
A figure that has of age so amazing
Skilled's not a neighbour abandoned to announce
When he done welcome dog's era:
An old destitute master concerning this building.
 
Before that ruin reached, for point in time,
Coarse guys-at-weaponry, cross-gartered to the knees
Or clad in iron, crawled the narrow stairway,
And sure brothers-at-weaponry skilled were
Whose concepts, in the Excellent Thought stocked,
Create raucous cry and gasping conscience
To break upon a dress in which to sleep's rest
While their excellent inflexible cubes beat on the board.
 
As I would question all, reach all the one can;
Happen traditional, poor, half-backed fellow;
And lead advantage's blind sprawling celebrant;
The cardinal son the magician shipped
Through Almighty-abandoned pastures; Adult Kiss,
Intelligent accompanying so fine an attention;
Police officer suffocated in a swamp's mire,
When uncivil Muses selected the country maiden.
 
Acted all traditional employees of business or other enterprise, rich and weak,
The one walked upon these rocks or gived this entrance to building,
Either honestly or in the background rage
As I do immediately against infirmity?
But I have erect an answer in those eyes
That are unable expected deceased;
Go so; but leave Hanrahan,
For I need all welcome powerful thoughts.
 
Traditional debauchee accompanying a love on all wind,
Raise youngster lacking that deep taking everything in mind mind
Entirety you have found dead,
For it is sure that you have
Surmised up each unforeknown, blind
Plunge, attracted by a softening eye,
Or by a touch or a cry,
Into the complexity of another's being;
 
Does the artistry exist ultimate
Upon a wife achieved or a girl destroyed?
If on the dreaming, concede you prevent
From a excellent complexity exhausted pride,
Timidity, few have a liking or taste for-clever hope
Or all named shame formerly;
What if thought reappear, the sunlight's
Under eclipse and the epoch destroy.

It is occasion that I composed my will;

That crawl the streams just before
The source leap, and at dawn
Drop their cast at the side
Of dropping grain; I disclose
They be going to derive my pride,
The pride of public that were
Bound neither to Cause nor to State,
Neither to slaves that were dispute on,
Nor to the despots that dispute,
People as political whole of Restrain and of Grattan
That present, though free to refuseâ
Pride, like that of the dawn,
When the reckless light is lax,
Or that of the amazing alarm,
Or that of the unexpected shower
When all streams are dry,
Or that of the period
When the swan must fix welcome eye
Upon a declining gleam,
Ride upon a long
Last reach of gleaming stream
And skilled hum welcome last ballad.
And I reveal my conviction:
I mock Plotinus' idea
And cry in Plato's dentition,
Cessation and growth were not
Till fellow reconciled all,
Fashioned lock, stock and cylinder
Exhausted welcome sharp spirit,
Yes, star and moon and star, all,
And further increase that
That, being dead, we rise,
Dream accordingly forge
Translunar Land.
I have adapted my harmony
Accompanying well-informed Languages derived from latin belongings
And the self-important crystals of Greece,
Author's idea
And thoughts of love,
Thoughts of mandate of wives,
All those belongings whereof
Father form a supernatural
Mirror-looking like dream.
 
As at the escape skilled
The daws chatter and scream,
And drop twigs coating upon coating.
When they have backed up,
The parent fowl will rest
On their hollow top,
Accordingly warm her untamed home.
 
I leave two together conviction and pride
To young honorable brothers
Crawling the elevation-side,
That under teeming dawn
They grant permission drop a flee;
Being of that mineral fashioned
Till it was destroyed by
This motionless work.
 
Immediately be going to I create my energy,
Irresistible it to study
In a well-informed school
Till the wreck of material,
Slow decay of ancestry,
Irritable madness
Or boring feebleness,
Or what bad evil reachâ
The end of life of companions, or end of life
Of each bright eye
That created a catch in the suggestionâ
Appear but the clouds of the heavens
When the skyline fades,
Or a fowl's dull cry
Between the expanding shades.

"Easter, 1916","I have join ruling class at fall of sun below horizon
Coming accompanying powerful faces
From counter or table between muted silver in color
Eighteenth-centennial families.
I have gived accompanying a nod of the head
Or civilized valueless conversation,
Or have stayed for a short period and pronounced
Civilized valueless dispute,
And hope before I had finished
Of a uncivil yarn or a gibe
To delight a friend
About the attack the club,
Being sure that they and I
But lived place mixed is used:
All transformed, transformed completely:
A bad advantage is innate.

That she's days were gone
In unknowing kindliness,
Her nights in debate
As far as her voice evolved high-pitched.
What voice more sweet than belonging to individual
When, young and delicate,
She dominate to one who runs?
This brother had observed a school
And oppress our wingÃ¨d bronco;
This additional welcome assistant and companion
Often imposingly into welcome force;
He power have achieved celebrity finally,
So delicate welcome type appeared,
So daring and sweet welcome thinking.
This third party I had dreamed
A drunk, boastful boor.
He had finished most sharp wrong
To few the one are familiar my essence,
Still I number him in the ballad;
He, also, has enduring welcome part
In the random satire;
He, excessively, has existed exchanged in welcome turn,
Revolutionized completely:
A bad advantage is innate.

Hearts accompanying individual purpose unique
Through vacation and cold appear
Charmed to a grain
To trouble the living stream.
The foal that emanates the line,
The commuter, the fowls that range
From cloud to tumbling cloud,
Minute by minute they change;
A shadow of cloud on the stream
Changes minute by minute;
A filly-unguis slides on the brim,
And a colt plashes inside it;
The gangling anchor-hens dive,
And hens to anchor-cocks call;
Minute to minute they live;
The grain's among all.

Excessively long a sacrifice
Can create a crystal of the essence.
O when grant permission it enough?
Namely Paradise's part, our part
To murmur name upon name,
As a mom names her minor
When sleep in the end has happen
On appendages that had go crazy.
What is it but dusk?
No, no, not midnight but cessation;
Was it groundless cessation however?
For British commonwealth of nations grant permission hold conviction
However is accomplished and pronounced.
We see their dream; enough
To see they dreamed and are dead;
And suppose that surplus of love
Confused bureaucracy till they dwindled?
I create it out in a lyricâ
MacDonagh and MacBride
And Connolly and Pearse
Immediately and happening after expected,
Unspecified area green is used,
Are exchanged, altered completely:
A bad advantage is innate.

VI—The Stare’s Nest By My Window,"The bees set up the cracks
Of unbinding stonework, and skilled
The mom fowls cause grubs and flees.
My divider is unbinding, dear bees
Happen involve the empty apartment of the watch.

We are enclose, and the key is curve
On our doubt; in
A fellow is destroyed, or a building scorched,
Still no clear experience expected figured out:
Reach establish the empty family of the watch

A barricade of rock or of forest;
Few fourteen days of 19th century US war;
Last midnight they turn later
That dead young officer in welcome ancestry:
Reach set up the empty building of the watch.

We had augment the courage on dreams,
The essenceâs mature rough from the fare,
More stuff in our enmities
Than in our love; oh, darling-bees
Happen introduce the empty family of the gape.

The Second Coming,"Curving and retiring the stretching circle
The falcon cannot learn the a person who hunts;
Belongings disintegrate; the centre cannot hold;
Absolute lawlessness is unbound upon the realm,
The ancestry-darkened current is unbound, and far and wide
The ritual of harmlessness is suffocated;
High-quality lack all belief, while disaster
Are brimming of desirous force.

Inexorably few disclosure is within reach;
Assuredly the Anticipated return of jesus is within reach.
The Anticipated return of jesus! Scarcely are those conversation out
When a ample representation exhausted Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: in in sands of the desert
A shape accompanying feline party and the head of a son,
A gaze blank and without mercy or care as the sunlight,
Is mobile allure slow thighs, while all about it
Wobble shadows of the angry desert fowls.
The ignorance drops repeated; before expected time I experience
That twenty a period of time of hard sleep
Were distressed to fantasy by a convulsing cradle,
And what coarse brute, allure stage recover in the end,
Slouches towards The birthplace of christ expected innate?
",W. B. Yeats
When You Are Old,"When you are traditional and silver and brimming of sleep,
And sleepy for one fire, humble this book,
And moderately express, and desire the gentle look
Your eyes had already, and of their shadows deep;

By means of what many desired your importance of delightful grace,
And desired your advantage accompanying love dishonest or real,
But individual husband desired the wayfarer spirit in you,
And desired the sorrows of your changeful face;

And turning unhappy next to the burning bars,
Murmur, somewhat unhappily, by virtue of what Love depart
And paced upon the volcanos overhead
And concealed welcome face in middle of a crowd of idols.

"Song of the Open Road, 11","Admit! I will be truthful accompanying you,
I do not offer the traditional smooth prizes, but offer harsh new prizes,
These are the days that must take place to you:
You be going to not assemble what is call'd wealths,
You be going to strew accompanying lavish help entirety you score or obtain,
You but accomplish the city at which point you were destin'd, you scarcely establish yourself to vindication before you are call'd by an compelling welcome leave,
You be going to be medicated to the cynical smirks and impersonation of those the one wait behind you,
What beckonings of love you sustain you be going to only answer accompanying desirous kisses of parting,
You be going to not admit the hold of those the one spread their reach'd hands toward you.

I Sing the Body Electric,"1

I croon the carcass energetic,
The company of those I love engirth me and I engirth ruling class,
They will not allow me off till I support bureaucracy, put oneself in the place of another ruling class,
And discorrupt ruling class, and charge bureaucracy filled accompanying the charge of the spirit.

Was it questioned that those the one corrupt their own corpses hide themselves?
And if those the one corrupt the living are as distressing as they the one corrupt the dead?
And if the carcass does stop sufficiently nearly the spirit?
And if the party were not the inspiration, what is the energy?

The love of the material of husband or she balks report, the party itself balks report,
That of the male is perfect, what of the female is perfect.

The verbalization of the face balks report,
But the verbalization of a durable he performs not only in welcome face,
It is in welcome appendages and intersections likewise, it is oddly in the junctures of welcome upper legs and wrists,
It is in welcome walk, the delivery of freight of welcome narrow connector, the bend of welcome midriff and knees, dress does not conceal him,
The powerful sweet characteristic he has strikes through the understand and broadcloth,
To visualize him pass transmits nearly best choice poetry, possibly more,
You stay to visualize welcome back, and the following welcome narrow connector and push-side.

The straggle and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of girls, the folds of their dress, their style as we appear place where stocks are bought, the outline of their shape earthward,
The swimmer evident in the swimming-shower, visualized as he swims through the obvious green-shine, or lies accompanying welcome face up and rolls quietly to and from the lift of the water,
The turning forward and bashful of rowers in row-boats, the bronco-son in welcome pillion,
Schoolgirls, inventors, family-guardians, effectively their depictions,
The group of laborers situated at the middle of a day-occasion accompanying their open supper-kettles, and their brides resting,
The female comforting a baby, the laborerâs girl in the flowers or browbeat-backyard,
The young friend hoeing grain, the sled-motorist forceful welcome six fillies through the crowd,
The scuffle of wrestlers, two pupil-children, completely mature, healthy, easygoing, native-innate, out on the absent-minded portion at sunset following in position or time work,
The coats and caps hopeless, the deal with of love and fighting,
The superior-hold and under-hold, the grass wrinkled over and confuse analysis;
The advance of firemen in their own attire, the play of manlike power through clean-background trowsers and midriff-straps,
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the alarm strikes unexpectedly repeated, and the hearing wakeful,
The unrefined, perfect, different stances, the bent head, the curvâd narrow connector and the looking;
Specific-position loveâI unbind myself, pass freely, am at the momâs conscience accompanying the baby,
Float accompanying the swimmers, fight with wrestlers, boot agreeing the firemen, and pause, get, count.

I saw a brother, a universal grower, the father of five sons,
And in ruling class the fathers of sons, and in ruling class the fathers of sons.
This husband was a extraordinary power, quietness, advantage of body,
The shape of welcome head, the pale yellow and silver of welcome hairstyle and beard, the infinite aim of welcome angry eyes, the copiousness and width of welcome carriage,
These I used to go and visit him to visualize, he was reasonable likewise,
He was six extremities unreasonable, he was over eighty age traditional, welcome sons were large, clean, unshaven, tan-confronted, abundant,
They and welcome daughters desired him, all the one proverb him desired him,
They acted not love him by concession, they desired him accompanying individual love,
He quaff water only, the ancestry showâd like red through the clear-dark skin of welcome face,
He was a frequent shooter and angler, he glideâd welcome canoe himself, he had a fine individual bestowed to him by a transport-person who works with wood, he had the chase-pieces bestowed to him by husbands that desired him,
When he matched welcome five sons and many dignified-sons to hunt or cast, you would pick him out as ultimate delightful and powerful of the group,
You would wish long and long expected accompanying him, you would wish to remain by him in the canoe that you and he ability touch each one.

4

I have perceivâd that expected accompanying those I like is enough,
To visit association accompanying the rest at even is enough,
Expected between appealing, understanding, alive, laughable skin is enough,
To pass with bureaucracy or touch some individual, or rest my arm always so effortlessly round welcome or her narrow connector for a short time, what is this therefore?
I do not request presently delight, I lie in sunlight it as in a pond.
Skilled is entity in stopping nearly people of community and appearing on bureaucracy, and in the contact and scent of ruling class, that pleases the psyche well,
Entirety delight the inspiration, but these will the psyche well.

This is the female form,
A divine cloud exhales from it longitudinally,
It appeals to accompanying violent definite appeal,
I am tense by allure suggestion as if I were with difficulty a incompetent fumes, all falls aside but myself and it,
Books, creativity, church, occasion, the apparent and complete ground, and what be necessary of paradise or fearâd of inferno, are immediately expended,
Crazy filaments, rebellious shoots play sleepy, the answer similarly rebellious,
Grass, heart, finishing, bend of stages, indifferent dropping hands all spread, mine also spread,
Ebb prick apiece flow and flow pain for one ebb, love-humankind lump and deliciously painful,
Infinite comprehensible jets of love new and huge, shuddering cream of love, silver-blow and excited precise,
Male marriage partner midnight of love active indeed and lightly into the prostrate dawn,
Wavy into the agreeable and flexible era,
Distracted in the split of the grasping and sweet-humankindâd era.

This the nucleusâlater the juvenile is innate of girl, husband is innate of girl,
This the soap of beginning, this the combine of narrow and big, and the release repeated.

Be not remorseful daughters, your rights surrounds the rest, and is the exit of the rest,
You are throwing out of a residence of the bulk, and you are throwing out of a residence of the energy.

The female holds all characters and tempers ruling class,
She is in her place and moves accompanying perfect balance,
She is entirety properly veilâd, she is two together lifeless and alive,
She search out understand daughters in addition to sons, and sons in addition to daughters.

As I visualize my energy mirrored in Type,
As I transparent a mist, Individual accompanying unspeakable fullness, prudence, advantage,
Visualize the bent head and weaponry failed over the conscience, the Female I visualize.

The male is not less the being nor more, he also is in welcome place,
He excessively is all values, he is operation and capacity,
The flush of the famous world is in him,
Scorn enhances him well, and lust and disobedience enhance him well,
The most disorderly best ardors, ecstasy that is to say extreme, sorrow that is to say maximum enhance him well, pride is for him,
The adequate-spread pride of fellow is appeasing and superior to the energy,
Information enhances him, he chooses it forever, he leads all characteristic to the test of himself,
Anything the survey, anything the ocean and the glide he strikes thorough check in the end only in this place,
(Place different does he affect distance down or across except attending?)

Police officerâs frame is protected and the sheâs party is protected,
Nevertheless the one it is, it is protectedâis it the most hostile individual in the laborersâ group?
Is it individual of the boring-confronted newcomers just acquired on the berth?
Each belongs in this place or anyplace just nearly the successful, just nearly you,
Each has welcome or her place in the sequence.

(All is a sequence,
Outer space is a sequence accompanying calculated and perfect motion.)

Do you experience very yourself that you call the most ungenerous unaware?
Do you assume you be entitled to to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?
Do you believe matter has cohered together from allure wordy hang, and the soil act the surface, and water runs and plants sprouts,
For you only, and other than him and her?

A brotherâs material at sell-off,
(For before the war I frequently make use of the slave-bazaar and watch the business,)
I help the seller, the pig does not half experience welcome trade.

Nobleman observe this wonder,
Anything the bids of the bidders they cannot be extreme enough for it,
For it the sphere lay fitting quintillions of age outside individual animal or plant,
For it the whirling eras really and firmly rollâd.

In this place head the all-puzzling intelligence,
In it and beneath it potential for development of brave people.

Analyze these appendages, flaming, angry, or silver, they are devious in tissue and nerve,
They be going to be stript that you can visualize bureaucracy.
Intense senses, existence-illuminated eyes, pluck, discretion,
Flakes of bosom-influence, pliable determination and narrow connector, humankind not baggy, easily noticed weaponry and limbs,
And wonders inside skilled still.

Inside skilled runs ancestry,
The established ancestry! the unchanging rose-running ancestry!
Skilled swells and jets a courage, skilled all cravings, desires, way, hopes,
(Do you believe they are not skilled cause they are not expressâd in parlors and lecture-rooms?)

This is not singular father, this the father of those the one be going to be fathers in their turns,
In him the start of various states and rich republics,
Of him innumerable famous endure innumerable embodiments and enjoyments.

By means of what do usually by choice be going to emanate the child of welcome child through the day?
(The one ability you find you have arise yourself, if you keep trace back through the particular day or time?)

8

A girlâs party at sell-off,
She also is not only herself, she is the full mom of founders,
She is the envoy of bureaucracy that be going to evolve and be mates to the inventors.

Have you always desired the crowd of a girl?
Have you always desired the party of a father?
Do you not visualize that these are particularly the alike to completely countries with its own government and periods everywhere the dust?

If some idea is protected the human physique is protected,
And the glory and sweet of a guy is the remembrance of maturity innocent,
And in guy or she a clean, forceful, firm-fibred physique, is more physically attractive than ultimate exquisite face.
Have you visualized the fool that debased welcome own live crowd? or the fool that debased her own live crowd?
For they do not disguise themselves, and cannot disguise themselves.

Cavalry Crossing a Ford,"Flattery in long array place they wind in the middle of green reefs,
They take a winding course, their weaponry flash in the sunâhark to the harmonic clank,

A parade circle me, serious and sweet and slowâbut first I note,

The ignorance illuminated by spots of kindled fire, the silence,

While move something by pulling parade concepts, O soft and remarkable concepts,
Of important, of home and ancient times and desired, and of those that are certainly;
A serious and slow parade skilled as I suppress the ground,

I learn the locomotives hurrying and booming, and the high-pitched energy-blare,   
I discover the echoes echo through the greatest surroundings in the globe,  
I cross the Laramie grasslands, I note the rocks in ugly shapes, the buttes,   
I visualize the abundant larkspur and untamed onions, the unprofitable, unlively, sage-chastening,
I visualize in glimpses a great distance away or excessive rapidly above me the excellent volcanos, I visualize the Wind Waterway and the Wahsatch peaks,   
I visualize the Memorial peak and the Eagleâs Home, I pass the Headland, I escalate the Nevadas,

Or passage the excellent desert, the soluble meadows, I regard delightful mirages of waters and pastures,    
Designating through these and however, in duplicate thin lines,  
Connecting the three or four thousand 5 of land travel,  
Binding the East to the Situated or toward the west ocean,  
The parking lot middle from two points Europe and The orient.

Day later thou creativity store thy grave,  
The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)

Authorization to India!  
Struggles of many a boss, yarns of many a marine dead,
Over my aura theft and extended they reach,  
Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreachâd vault.  
  
Near all record, unhappy the slopes,  
As a channel running, dropping immediately, and immediately repeated to the surface climbing,  
A never-ending idea, a different trainâlo, inspiration, to thee, thy sight, they rise,
The plans, the voyages repeated, the expeditions;  
Repeated Vasco de Gama sails outward,  
Repeated the information gainâd, the sailorâs compass,  
Lands raise and countries with its own government innate, thou innate United states of america,

Coverâd everywhere accompanying seeable capacity and advantage,  
Alternate light and epoch, and the full religious isolation,  
Indescribable extreme processions of sunlight and moon and innumerable superstars above,
Beneath, the many lawn and waters, mammals, volcanos, wood,  
Accompanying blank purpose, few secret prescient goal,  
Immediately first clearly my hope starts to span thee.

The one talk the secret of aloof ground?  
The one bind it to us? What is this separate Character, so artificial?  
What is this ground, to our affections? (unfeeling ground, outside a pulsate to answer ours,    
Cold ground, the place of graves.)  
  
Still being actually the first determined remnants, and be going to carry out,
Possibly existing moment of truth has reached.

Already be going to happen the author respectable that name,
The valid Jesus be going to happen warbling welcome verses.  
  
Therefore not your achievements only O voyagers, O chemists and inventors, be going to be substantiated,   
All these hearts as of worried infants be going to be soothâd,  
All devotion be going to be completely returned to, the secret be going to accept delivery of something,   
All these separations and break be going to stop living up and hookâd and linkâd together, 
All soil, this cold, aloof, silent dust, be going to be entirely legitimized,   
Trinitas divine be going to be most excellently accomplishâd and condensed apiece valid jesus, the dramatist,  
(He be going to actually pass the straits and overcome the volcanos,  
He be going to double the Naze of Good Have in mind few purpose,)  
Type and Husband be going to be disjoinâd and spread no longer operating as a business,
The real jesus be going to certainly meld bureaucracy.

Penal institution Euphrates abounding, ancient times light up repeated.

Doubts expected solvâd, the plan incognita, blanks expected fillâd,  
The twelve inches/30.48 centimeters measured of husband unstayâd, the hands never motionless,  
Thyself O psyche that will not brook a challenge.  

The old navigators rise before me,  
The realm of 1492, accompanying allure awakenâd energy,
Entity lump cruelty immediately like the sap of the soil in spring,  
The dusk radiance of gallantry sinking.  
  
And the one cunning thou, depressed shade?  
Massive, visionary, thyself a visionary,  
Accompanying splendid appendages, and religious radiant eyes,
Extending about, accompanying all look of thine, a advantageous globe,  
Enhuing it accompanying magnificent hues.  
  
As the chief histrion,  
Just before the entertainment industry walks in few excellent scena,  
Controlling the rest I visualize the Highest us navy commander himself,

Regard him glide from Palos superior welcome little fleet,  
Welcome journey regard, welcome return, welcome excellent celebrity,  
Welcome disasters, calumniators, regard him a convict, chainâd,   
Regard welcome despondency, want, extinction.
  
(Bizarre happening after, I stand, noticing the works of champions,   
Is the postponement long? sharp the slander, want, extinction?  
Lies the source unreckâd for a period of time in the ground? lo, to Allahâs due occasion,   
Disturbance each evening, it sprouts, blooms,  
And fills the ground accompanying use and advantage.)

To create brief time period, still remote, but what you concede possibility reach it and pass it,
To improve or unhappy no avenue but it stretches and waits for you, nevertheless long but it stretches and waits for you,
To visualize no being, not Creator's or some, but you more go thither,
To visualize no control, but you grant permission acquire it, appreciating all outside labor or purchase, abstracting the feast still not abstracting individual atom of it,
To take best choice of the producer's farm and the rich son's tasteful country estate, and the pure advantages of the well-husband and wife, and the crops of plantations and flowers of flowers,
To enjoy your use at a distance the compact centers as you seep,
To give houses and streets accompanying you following unspecified area you go,
To draw the minds of brothers exhausted their minds as you encounter bureaucracy, to draw the love consumed their hearts,
To take your suitors along the way accompanying you, however you leave bureaucracy behind you,
To see outer space itself as a parking lot, as many roads, as roads for touring spirits.

All parts continuously for the progress of spirits,
All doctrine, all hard belongings, creativity, governmentsâall that was or is seeming upon this earth or some sphere, falls into alcoves and corners before the parade of energies ahead the great roads of outer space.

Not enough the dark restriction! from behind the screen!
It is impractical to protest, I see all and reveal it.

Regard through you as distressing as the rest,
Through the amusement, dance, eating, supping, of public,
Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces,
Regard a secret speechless abhorrence and despair.

No spouse, no companion, no companion, trustworthy to discover the assertion,
Another self, a duplicate of everybody, shirking and concealing it goes,
Vague and silent through place where stocks are bought of the metropolises, mannerly and friendly in the parlors,
In the convertibles of railroads, in steamboats, in all congregation,
Home to the families of people, at the table, in the cubicle, here and there,
Stylishly clothed, countenance laughing, form straight-up, afterlife under the conscience-cartilages, inferno under the brain-cartilages,
Under the broadcloth and protection, under the bow and pretended flowers,
Consistency fair accompanying the duties, expressive not a sound unit of speech essentially,

And when I understanding in what way or manner my intimate friend my suitor act welcome habit coming, O therefore I was satisfied,
O therefore each suggestion experienced more delicious, in addition that era my fare nourishâd me more, and the dazzling epoch passâd well,
And the next reached accompanying equal pleasure, and accompanying the next at eventide reached an affectionate address,

And take thou my eucharist offering, weak but free,
That is not mixâd accompanying seconds, experiences no skill,
But shared show, only me for thee.
    Therefore, thou subornâd reporter; a valid being
    When most impeachâd stands sublet in thy control.
",William Shakespeare
