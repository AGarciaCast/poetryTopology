What would one do with some money, if he had it, perhaps

to dance out softly

On slices of pizza.

a fictional character. It was not until
The age of forty-eight I knew she was real.

Wrapped around her head
In low cost tenement housing.

And her sex life.

I took love home with me,
we fixed in the night and
sank into a stinging flash.

¼ grain of love
          we had
2 men on a cot, a silk
cover and a green cloth
over the lamp.
        The music was just right.
I blew him like a symphony,
   it floated and
          he took me
down the street and
          left me here.
3 AM. No sign.

          only a moving van
          up Van Ness Avenue.

             came down.

John Wieners,"Knowing no other god than this:
the man who places on your mouth
a kiss. Keep no mystery
but his who whispers memory.

Though he lead you to the desert
or over hills where famine
flowers, like the locust
he devours what he loves most.

Saving none for tomorrow, or dawn
comes with empty arms, and he knows no way
to feed himself, feeding off others,
he has many, who find him, help him

and misery to the upkeep of this cheapskate

with their common habits and rude manners,

who leaves no trace, but lingers through the room
after he has gone, so I would follow

anywhere, over desert or mountain,
it’s all the same if he’s by my side.
The guide and wizard I would worship and obey,
my guardian teacher, who knows how to stay

alive on practically nothing in the city
until help comes, usually from a stranger or youth.
Such I am or was who knew no better
but all that I better forget now since I met you

and fell into that pit of the past with no escape.
You knock on the door, and off I go with you
into the night with not even a cent in my pockets,
without caring where or when I get back

But if once you put your hand on my shoulders
as David Rattray did last evening
that would be enough, on the seventh night

John Wieners,"Sustained by poetry, fed anew
by its fires to return from madness,
the void does not beckon as it used to.

Littered with syllables, the road does not loom
as a chasm. The hand of strangers on other

does not desert, but looms large
as a dream, a prairie within our dream,

and with a woman
she wanted another one

I died in loneliness

but that I am a clank

without a dream of adolescence
frustration plucked as strong

I died in loneliness
without friends or money
they were taken off
long ago, a melodrama
sounded out my name, the glass key of a

He is demoralized through excessive beat exertion.
He cannot take orders even for the good of himself

He surrenders for despair although believes surrounding conditions.
He produces fiery revolution in unconscious rebellion.
He believes anything that happens
as misfortune of others.

Quickening as rain on highways, he plunges into chance
faith, duty or conscience culminating legends
of eros, beauty, will & condition
upon distance or parent organization.

He swims with the tide, taking care
he has undressed for it & surveyed its relation
to majority use, freely contributing to its content & current form,
little saving resources toward relentless tides

What is poetry? an image
      in the mirror;
reflection from a broadside
    pinned to the wall,
    penned by a friend,
        from where old feelings

relief from pain; the diligence of work.

Mysterious words upon a page in adolescence;
listening to poets read. What is poetry?
