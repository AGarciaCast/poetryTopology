Christina Rossetti,"Sweetheart, since the bright earth is fair,
   And spring has come with leaves of green,
My lips shall tell thee of my love,
   Or else I shall not speak at all:

Sweetheart, since the bright earth is fair,
   And spring has come with leaves of green,
The lilies and the roses wear
   My smile and my love with them:

Sweetheart, since the bright earth is fair,
   And spring has come with leaves of green,
The lilies and the roses wear
   My smile and my love with them.",A Lily of the Valley
Christina Rossetti,"Gather ye Rosebuds while ye may
     Old Time is still a-flying:
And this same flower that smiles today
     To-morrow will be dying.

The violet's blue eyes have filled
     My heart with mournful thinking:
The lily's sweet life will waken
     The rose to blush and spring.

The rose will keep her beauty,
     The violet keep its blue;
But I shall die, like the Rose,
     With all its beauty too.",Rosebuds
Christina Rossetti,"To him who wrought her salvation,
    Though I know not where He dwells,
The night and the darkness bring
    No fear for me, my Lord;
Thou, the living Lord of life,
    Why didst thou die for me?

‘Why died I for a sinful wife?’
     She said: but the answer came
And left her face half veiled and pale
     By the snow-like falling hair,
Her mouth dropt a little aside
     Like a red rosebud that blows,
And her red lips’ sweetness he knew,
     And her mouth dropt a little low.

‘I have brought the good news to thee:
     I have brought the good news to thee:
Thou shalt be a sinner no more.
     I have brought the good news to thee.’
The silence that filled her soul
     Was a great and wonderful thing;
But the quiet voice said no more.
     And she dropt a little lower.

And he knew that her soul had gained
     Her lips that were like the red rosebud,
And the rose lips were ever kind,
     For he felt them he loved so;
And he knew that her soul had found
     The speech of the Eternal Word
That gives no answer to sin,
     And her soul dropt a little low.

‘O God, the Eternal One,
     Make known the good news to me!
For I am faint, my Lord, I am faint.
     Make known to me the good news.","To Him, Who Wrought Her Salvation"
Christina Rossetti,"A baby is a harmless thing
     And wins our hearts with one accord,
And Flower of Babies was their King,
     Jesus Christ our Lord:
Lily of lilies He
Upon His Mother’s knee,
Rose of roses, soon to be
Crowned with thorns on leafless tree.

A lamb is innocent and mild
     And merry on the soft green sod;
And Jesus Christ, the Undefiled,
     Is the Lamb of God:
Only spotless He
Upon His Mother’s knee;
White and ruddy, soon to be
Sacrificed for you and me.

Nay, lamb is not so sweet a word,
     Nor lily half so pure a name;
Another name our hearts hath stirred,
     Kindling them to flame:
“Jesus” certainly
Is music and melody:
Heart with heart in harmony
Carol we and worship we.

Jesus, I bless Thee,
     Jesus, I praise Thee;
I bless Thee, and I praise Thee,
     Jesus, Saviour, God.

Praise, Lord, praise, praise, praise,
     For Jesus, our Saviour;
Praise, praise, praise, praise, praise,
     For Jesus, God.

Oh, Jesus, I bless Thee,
     Oh, Jesus, I bless Thee;
I bless Thee, I praise Thee,
     Oh, Saviour, God.",Christmas Day
Christina Rossetti,"What though the sun is shining,
   And the day is warm and bright,
I am so lonely,
   So lonely, I wail and sigh,
The summer morn is breaking,
   And all the woods are grey.

What though the night is falling,
   And the wind is sobbing loud,
I am so lonely,
   So lonely, I wail and sigh,
The night is darkening,
   And all the forest deeps
Are still with wild things sleeping.

O singing morn, remember
   The day that we were born,
Remember, and the Mother
   That bore us, dearer far
Than the strong singing,
   And all the wild wood things
That wail and cry for bread.

Where are they now, the old Mother
   And the dear dead day?
We cannot find the Mother,
   The dead day we can see;
But the sun shines bright and warm,
   And we are living still,
And all the woods are green.

And then, the singing morn, remember
   The day that we were born,
Remember, and the Mother
   That bore us, dearer far
Than the strong singing,
   And all the wild wood things
That wail and cry for bread.",The Singing Morn
Christina Rossetti,"The fair Spring, the great Spring,
   I see thee and rejoice;
I hear thy voice in the breeze
   And in the whispering leaves.

The birds in their greenwood bowers
   Make sweet their loves to each
And sing their loves, and the flowers
   Gather green and white to each.

The stars in their heaven-blue
   Gaze down on the green leaves
And we have a heaven of blue
   To love our God in.

I love the green, and the green,
   And the green, the beauteous Spring;
The fair Spring, the great Spring,
   I see thee and rejoice.",Spring Song
Christina Rossetti,"Ivy Green—its sad green leaves
   Shed their dewy tears at even,
And the dripping boughs above
   With the hoarse winds keep not still;
Yet the white roses in their clime
   Wept for one whose spirit went
Somewhere else, nor came again.

Never mind! his spirit is
   Where the dews in dewy rain
Drop, and leaves are folded in green,
   Over some grave forlorn:
And his fair soul is at rest,
   Nor is troubled by wailing
Leaves that shed their tears for him.

Ah, this is Ivy Green,
   The sweet ivy that endears
Those who loved him when he was
   A man of this world’s cares:
Still in our hearts it makes
   Its pale green leaves to dwell
And its flowers to weep for those
   Whose eyes are shut in sleep.

But the heart that loved him well
   Will live in the heart of God,
And all his beauty with it,
   Hearts that break and die for him.

Them that are in love with him
   Weep not for him who is
Under the veil that veils
   The form that we knew so:
But the flower of him will grow
   In the hands of those who mourn,
And the dew of him will drop
   On the grave where he is gone.

When I am dead, my dearest,
   Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
   Nor shady cypress tree:
Be the green grass above me
   With showers and dewdrops wet;
And if thou wilt, remember,
   And if thou wilt, forget.",Ivy Green
Christina Rossetti,"A sick child is in the house:
     The mother is in anguish,
     The father and the nurse are
     Silent and heavy-hearted;
     The Christ is in the cradle,
     Jesus, He for whom
     The children pray.

     Born that they might be
     Merry and wise,

In the valley of Death

In the midst of life we are in death:
     Of whom may we seek for succour,
     But of thee, O Lord, alone;

     To save us from our misery?",In the Valley
Christina Rossetti,"At a far lonely place,
      Far from the eyes of men,
Where the winter’s coldest wind
      Howls and moans and sings,
Where the winter’s wildest storm
      Rages and chills and kills—
At a lonely place like this
      That hath no face nor name,

Lonely and deep is the waste
      Where the ravens cry:
Where the wintry starlight waits
      For the fates to die:

Weep thou not, for my lute will wake
      When I am dead and gone;
Thy voice will lull me as it should,
      As mine own lulls me now.

Lute-lady, lullaby,
I will remember thee,
Thy voice and thy blue eyes,
The sweetest blue eyes that
In the world’s broad daylight
Have shone down on my head.

Sorrow, I am here alone,
      The world knows not my name,
And I know not if I have
      A grave or a name.

Ah, weep not for me, I pray,
      But weep for the lute-lady,
Whose voice will soothe me away
      When I am dead and gone.

Lonely and deep is the waste,
      Where the ravens cry:
Thou art dead, but thy voice
      Will live for ever and aye.",Grave

Beneath a canopy of starry blue,
  In the cool moon-light, in a dreamy wood,
      A youth, the son of Mercury,
      Was sleeping, dreaming of a word
          From a divinèd maid.

At the close of day he rose, and in the stillness of the wood
  Heard a voice that sang:
“Endymion! Endymion!”

With a thrilling cry he sprang up, and the moon looked down on
      him with her bright face.

“O you whose name is never known to mortals, what is the
      word that I am dreaming of?”

“Endymion! Endymion!”

The voice grew low and tender, as if some one were whispering
      in his ear:
“Endymion! Endymion!”

The youth bent down his head, and the low voice went on, and
      the tones of her lips were so divine,

“Endymion! Endymion!”

A sudden thought was in his mind, and he looked up, and the
      celestial figure stood before him.

“What is the word I am dreaming of?”

“Endymion!”

“Then I have found it.”

He woke; and the wood echoed with his laughter, and the

For the wreckers of the world—
The poor and hungry men—
Who rob the weak and helpless
And make each other slaves,
There is no victory.

There is only a twisted path
Where the weak are trodden down,
And a little shivering heap
Is left of all that once was proud,
And the wreckers walk in the sun.",The Wreckers

Langston Hughes,"I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.

I came up once and hollered!
I came up twice and cried!
If that water hadn't a-been so cold
I might've sunk and died.

     But it was      Cold in that water!      It was cold!

I took the elevator
Sixteen floors above the ground.
I thought about my baby
And thought I would jump down.

I stood there and I hollered!
I stood there and I cried!
If it hadn't a-been so high
I might've jumped and died.

     But it was      High up there!      It was high!

So since I'm still here livin',
I guess I will live on.
I could've died for love—
But for livin' I was born

Though you may hear me holler,
And you may see me cry—
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
If you gonna see me die.

Robert Frost,"You that are not much for walking out of doors,
Lately I have found myself thinking more
About the eye than the foot and more than the ear,
And that, after all, is where the spirit comes in,
As the eye sees and the foot feels and the ear hears,
But it is the eye that really matters.
For my part I have had a few such eyes
That I remember. But to me the eye
That is the greatest gift of all, if you will,
For it makes of a man a poet, for it can
Look into the things of the world and the soul
And see as far and deep as the horizon's rim
As far as the farthest star or the farthest shore.
Oh, and yet I have seen some eyes that looked
Upon the far horizon and were blind as bats
To what was nearer than the stars or nearer
Than the earth's farthest crust.
Now, there are some who would have it that the eye
Is only a sight-organ and not a soul-eye,
And that you cannot look into the things of the world
Or see into the things of the soul without
Being drawn out of the body and swept away
Into the sights of heaven. And they are right.
But there are eyes that have a vision of their own
Of the deeps of heaven and the earth and the soul,
And yet remain in the body and have all
The faculties of the body. It is not the eye
But the eye's eye that matters. It is not the eye
But the eye that is the highest gift of all,
And the eye that is the greatest gift of all,
For it is the one that can see and not be seen.",The Gifts of a Quiet Eye

With a light in her bright hair;
The same Helen, all in Helen’s story,
Sleeping in the eyes of the world.

But the night, that has not left the earth,
And the grave, and the silence and the star,
Have changed the face of the sea, and the mouth
Of Helen is no longer Helen’s.

The men that were mad for the Trojan war,
That took from her the old sweet name,
That named the daughters of the sea
The daughters of Helen, and of fame,

Are gone and do not hear the songs
Of the old songs, and do not see
The light in Helen’s eyes,
And the light in Helen’s hair,

But follow, who have not been
Men, the light of the world,
The way of the old Helen,
The way of the bright hair.

And this were not the capital of all,
And the rest all dream and delusion,
And the most sacred and holy,
As if the soul were the main thing,
And the body but a secondary thing,
And the body the soul,
As if the soul were the real person,
And the body but a mask,
As if the real person were immortal,
And the mask were not so,
As if the real person were divine,
And the mask but an accident,
As if the divine were not alone,
As if the divine were not all,
As if there were not more in the divine than the divine,
As if there were not more in the divine than in the divine,
As if the divine were not all.","The Spirit that Compels, 7"
Walt Whitman,"I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and the laws of the leaf and the pismire are as much our laws as the laws of the star and the sun.

I believe the earth is no less than the body of God, and that the beauty and joy and freedom of the earth are the joy and freedom of God.","Song of the Broad Path, 7"
Walt Whitman,"I am large, I contain multitudes,
As the sand, the stars, the liquid constellations contain multitudes,
I contain you also.

I am an army of warriors,
I contain the lightning, and the lightnings contain me,
I am the oak tree, I the earth, I the sky,
I contain all, and as many more as there may be.","Song of Myself, 3"
Walt Whitman,"Ashes of soldiers,
I would create among you a warring joy,
And your minds become a fierce audacity,
And your bodies an invincible health.

I do not want the graves of soldiers to be beautiful,
I do not want the dead to be beautiful,
I would pass out of the dead returning to the living,
Out of the dead returning to the living,
And I do not want any dead returning.

I will tell you what I want.
I want the real American,
I want the man and woman who can afford to live without working,
I want the man and woman who can afford to die without dying,
I want the man and woman who can live without living.

(If you are the real American, if you are the man and woman I want,
Then for the love of your country let me have you.)",Ashes of Soldiers
Walt Whitman,"I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,
We convince by our presence.

I and mine do not live in houses,
We live in houses, and eat and drink in houses,
But I and mine are not contented with houses,
We desire a house of our own.

I and mine are not quiet,
We are too noisy for that,
We are the loudest of all the nations,
We never rest,

I and mine are not humble,
We are too proud for that,
We hate to be spoken of in the third person,
I and mine do not serve any but ourselves,

I and mine are not on any side,
We are too light-hearted for that,
We want to stand on our own bottom,
I and mine do not get married,

I and mine do not go to heaven,
We go everywhere, we live in the present,
We have no faith in the future,
I and mine do not mourn for the dead,

I and mine do not pray,
We talk all the time,
We think all the time,
We are not haunted by the ghosts of the past,
I and mine are too busy,

I and mine are not born of woman,
I and mine are too happy,
I and mine are not troubled with the mystery of life,
I and mine do not believe in the devil,

I and mine are not christian,
We are too healthy to be christian,
I and mine do not believe in the god of the sages,
I and mine do not believe in the god of the philosophers,
I and mine do not believe in the god of the moralists,
I and mine are too proud to be anything’s god.","I and Mine, 13"
William Shakespeare,"My glass will not let in day nor night
To make me any other company
Than that which thy affliction makes with me;
For when thy glass is full of tears, I see
No more thy face, in such an overflow
Of hot and cold, of light and dark, as thine:
For, by the oppressor’s deed, thy cheek lies bare,
The bondslave’s stripes do testify thy face,
And in dumb sullenness doth bear that face,
Which, to live pale, hath made thy living wan.
No marvel though thy breast be hollowed thus,
For who but knows thy heart, by thy good heart
Gives thee more torture than a woman’s tongue
Can speak out when she is tortur’d herself.
    Alas, poor heart! if thou but knewest how
    I am tormented with thy deprivation,
    Thou wouldst assist me, that I might do thee good,
    Or at the least speak to me from thy side.",My glass will not let in day nor night (Sonnet 142)
William Shakespeare,"Lines on the Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia
That lady loved not me nor would not hear,
When I would countenance the gentle suit
Of virtuous gentleman, but would give ear
To the base suit of proud aldermanry:
O, yet she loved; and when I told her so,
She made excuse for her faith’s flattery,
By saying, ‘Men loved me for my beauty,
And so I found; but what I could not change,
That only was in me, and that still
Is in my beauty; therefore I forsook
The heat of summer, for the winter’s cold.’
    O, pardon me, sweet love, if I repent
    My speaking to thee: thou art a courtier,
    And such as will not change. I’ll, therefore, write
    To her again, and, by the hand of her,
    Tell her thou art the Lord Love’s fool, and there
    Least that my love, which is her love, be known.",Lines on the Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia (Sonnet 138)
William Shakespeare,"O, how full of sweet bells is the month of May!
When daisies pied and violets blue,
And lady-smocks all silver white,
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue doth blow,
The year’s at the spring, and we may see
Till then, time’s threshing-floor; and thence shall flow
Whole rivers of blood, to the earth’s sorrowing clime;
And the rank tumour, that the care of heaven breeds,
Infecting planet-like, with piteous gall,
Shall, by the sun’s medical rule,
Be richly pound’d and that shall be our state,
When green-sickness stares in pale-faced May.
But O, what mortal needs must thou endure,
To open on one half the book of nature,
And yet be blind and send the other eye
After the rich treasure in the sky!
O, this Earth is but a barren stage,
To act a farce of kings and heroes,
Upon whose stage we play in mockery.
    Then what are kings, what heroes, then, what dances,
    What sport, what laughter, what rejoicing?
    O, sun, arise, and, travelling north,
    Ascend the great sphere’s fiery pole!","O, how full of sweet bells is the month of May!"
William Shakespeare,"All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
Then, the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school; and then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow; then, a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth; and then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.","All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players; (Sonnet 144)"
William Shakespeare,"I have a thousand faces in my head,
And every one says ‘I am the man’;
And yet, by all those faces that I see,
I am alone, till he that runs may read:
My glass shows me many a fair one,
And my poor heart, so full of love, doth think
With every one of those fair ones an end:
But in all these ’tis so singular,
And all these fair ones are so one to me,
One face of love, one weary sigh, one bate,
One thought, one pain, one weary fond reply,
One in another’s arms sleep-waking,
One in another’s bosom joy-being,
One in another’s bed-sick, sigh-healing:
Oh, there be nothing so absurdly fair!
    If this be fair, then no man is fair:
    And if to be is so, then none are.",I have a thousand faces (Sonnet 142)
William Shakespeare,"Now is the winter of my discontent;
Made glorious summer by this sonnet’s sun.
It is the season wherein the sweet birds sing,
Not, as the autumnal leaves, mapless and sere,
Who put on their brave array in cold blood,
Fear’d in winter what themselves in summer feared not;
But, as the spring’s starr’d and unfurled rhymes,
Do, at their birth, with more than middle grace
Present their beauty to the eye of night,
And keep their lustre till the great day break;
So, at this hour, now that the sun’s eye
Is at the centre top of heaven’s circle,
Do birds, or fans, or bells, or sweet musical
Winds, or sweet smell, or song, or any
thing at all, present their beauty to
the eye of this night and of the light,
Which after midnight will be the morning light.
    And such the time-begotten love that grows
    To this above the sun: it shines at noon.",Now is the winter of my discontent (Sonnet 147)
William Shakespeare,"When my love swears that she is made of truth,
Be sure of truth: Swear then, that you love her;
Or, be not sworn, but love her, and think
That she is true: for ’tis certain truth
Will prove you liar ere the day be old.
    Then, what need I be sworn, love takes my promise;
    And truth, love, truth should prove me for a lie,
    Or that I lie, I am a liar:
    So is she sworn, and I forsworn.
    Awake fair truth, and cease thy faint deceiving!
    Put off slumber, love! and be bright, fair day!
    For since the sun rose, my love hath been
    Dark, my dearest dear.",When my love swears that she is made of truth (Sonnet 149)
William Shakespeare,"My tongue to fast my palate doth oppose,
And part my wanton lips that they may not speak;
If it be sin to covet honour’s love
And that be sin to honour a fair face,
Why then I am the most offending soul
That lies under heaven.
To be beloved of you
Doth give my soul such delight
That she weeps to leave the use of sense
When that false beauty from her favour goes.
Now men flattered with your name do flatter me,
Infer my miseries from mine own weakness;
Say I love you for who you are, the better,
Since that I liken you to God; but who
Can love God and dislike a lovely face?
God, from his high estate, the great object
Of all the faculties and appetites,
Does in the souls of men set down his seal;
There, as a mark set up to scourge our wits,
He signs his own image, and doth it not
By writing in the hearts of men.  O! know,
The beauty of his creation is his mercy,
And one man in his gifts more than another.
    If I do love you for who you are,
    The better for your sweetest foe is wrong.",My tongue to fast my palate doth oppose (Sonnet 147)
William Shakespeare,"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost make me fear I shall be fooled too late,
And the blind heaven dost order all my ways,
For thou art every way so well prothee:
I have no plot of earth too hot or cold,
Thy beams my aching heart to heaven dost cast:
I am thy toy, whom thou mayst play at will,
Mine eye thy fee, and I thy subject still,
For I am all thy kingdom, and all thy will:
    Why dost thou then destroy my house with eyes,
    And fence it in with rosy-dropping trees?","O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power (Sonnet 144)"
William Shakespeare,"When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came to man’s estate,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish man’s mouth cannot cover
A man’s grievance nor make him amends;
For if the sun shall rise, ’twill shine,
No doubt, upon a foolish man;
How can he then conceal himself
Under the shadow of a tree?
    But man, the window of the soul,
    All but the blind are out: so, when
    The rain’s a-cold, the beggar’s benighted;
    Then no man cries, ‘Feeble sun!’ no, not he:
    For thou, O sun, hast thy right;
    Rights three: first, the day’s right; second, the land’s right;
    Third, the sea’s right; and by these rights,
    The sun’s right too.",When that I was and a little tiny boy (Sonnet 144)
